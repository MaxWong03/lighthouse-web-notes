# Day2 

1) Unexpected token errors occur when JS expected something that wasn't there, oten means we are missing a `()` or `{}`
2) Steps to debugging:
  * Start with an observation
  * Come up with hypotheses as to what could have caused the faulty behaivour 
  * Experiments and design to test each potential cause
  * Narrow the search until we discvoer every bug
  * Identify the incorrect behaviour and then examine the code for mistakes
3) Most thing in JS is consider truth except:
  * `0` (only falsty number) 
  * `"" (empty string)`
  * `null`
  * `undefined`
  * `NaN`
4) Tools for debugging:
  * node debugger
  * js tutor
  * console.log
5) Theres 6 types of primitives, anything else is an object:
  * `undefined`
  * `null`
  * `boolean`
  * `string`
  * `number`
  * `symbol`
6) Try to access value of a key that doesnt exist in an object will return `undefined`
7) `Object.keys(obj)` gives you all the keys for the object obj
8) `For ... in` gives you index
9) `For ... of` gives you element 
10) `hasOwnProperty(p)` check if an object has a specific property p
11) accessing object via `object[]` is good for automation
12) `clause1 && clause2 && clause3` if all 3 clauses are true, it will return the last last clause
13) you could use `clause1 && clause2 && clause3` to ensure there will be an argument for a function if you put the arguemnt variable at clause1
14) you could also do `clause1 && clause2 && clause3 && default Bheaviour`
