# Day 3

## Summary

1) Web development is a way of packaging and delivering user’s data
2) For of is array, for in is obj
3) It is generally considered good practice to start with solving simple scenarios first and then add more logic from there 
4) sometimes build test cases with function that you want to understand 
5) Read the code in the order that is executed 
6) JS put functions in memory, but don’t run its inside code until it is called
7) Javascript read inside out, and so should you (peel the onion)
8) String is a primitive, but when you call a function, it converts that string to an object 
9) Whenever an variable is assigned,  JS define its content. A content can be a copy of the value of a primitive, or a memory / reference of an object 
10) Variables contain numbers, they can either be numbers that mean something to us like  1, or the number can mean something to JS which is the location of some data(array, object)
11) When we assign a new variable a value based on another variable, it is copying the VALUE inside that original variable 
12) Good dev -> Have an attitude of “I dont know how to solve it, but I know I can figure it out”
13) Objects help organize multiple related data  (categorizing data), for the maintainability and understandability of the code (similar to a look up table, map)
14) When writing a new function, it helps to mock up the result 
15) You can put an object as const and still mutate it 
16) Work incrementally when you write a new function:
    * Write Skeelton function code
    * Write mock results
    * Write test cases
    * Call skeleton function code with test case
    * Work towards getting your function to return the mock results
17) Test case can be generalized as
    * primitives as values
    * object as values
18) Inspect object with 
    ```javascript 
     require('until').inspect
     ```
20) There is no `this` inside the arrow function  
21) `this` refers to the object the methods was called on
22) You can assign a new variable to the function variable you named and they will bheave the same way
23) Making a skeleton function where it return something can help you debug using assertion
