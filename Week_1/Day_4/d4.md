## Summary

1) functions can be referneced and passed as arguments when invoking other functions
2) Functions can be stored in variables and passed around
3) Functions can do everything that other objects can do (having properties assigned to them)
4) When looping through an object, no matter what you do, you cant do obj.anPropertyThatDoesntExist, you will just get undefined, if you want to assing it to something that ypou have to do obj[nowTheresAProperty]
```javascript
const myFn = function() {
  console.log("I am function.");
}

myFn.someAttribute = 42;
console.log(myFn.someAttribute);

function runner(f) {
  f();
}

runner(myFn);
```
* We assign a function to our variable `myFn`
* An attribute `someAttribute` is assigned to that function object
* A `runner` function is defined that runs the argument f that we pass it 
* We pass reference to our `myFn`, which gets invoked by the runner function
1) if you assign an attribute to a function, then the function's value (without invoking) will me `[Function: myFn] { someATtribute: value}`

### Call back functions
* is a function passed (by reference) into another function (recevier function)
* The recevier function is accepting behaviour to perform by calling the callback function that is now has access to
* The receiver function can decide to call the callback function at anytime, as many times as it wants
* you can use receive and call back when you have an action that does something you want and you wanna call it inself the receiver function, but then you dont want to define it inside the receiver
* When you use callback, you are passing a reference to the function as the arugment, the argument is known as callback function
* Callback gets defined, passed as an argument, then execute when a specific event occurs inside the receiver
* Callback always return undefined, typically you used it to execute side effects
* you cant break or stop out of a forEach unless its an error
* Passing callback allows us to pass on behvaiours into other functions
```javascript
const findWaldo = function(names, found) {
  names.forEach((name, index)=>{
    if (name === 'Waldo') {
      found(index);
    }
  });
};

findWaldo(["Alice", "Bob", "Waldo", "Winston"], (index) => {
  console.log(`Found Waldo at index ${index}`);
});
```
* Here, you are having a function that `expects a callback`, and it gets the callback when you call the function at line 47
* when it was written, it was probably under some logic like "if under certain events, do something", then do someting will be hanlde by the callback
* `anoymous functions` is not named or assigned to a variable, it only exist and invoked when calling the receiver function

## Arrow Functions
```javascript
[1,2,3].forEach(num => console.log('num: ', num));
```
* For oneline, you dont need bracket and curly barcket
* There is no this in arrow functions

## Higher Order Function
* Functions that take in callbacks are referred to as Higher Order Functions
* Higher-Order functions are any functions which operate on other functions.
* forEach, filter are higher order functions because they operate on the annymous function ` () => ` you passed on 
* Higher-order functions is a major part of `Functional Programming`

## Why Functional Programming
* Less Bugs
  * Easier to reason about
* Less time
  * Re-use more 
* Higher Order Functions are good for composition 
* The fact that we can take one function and put it in another function allow us to compose a lot of smaller functions into a bigger functios 
* reject does the opposite of filter
* You are allow to think and reason and debug seperate functions  because they are higher order functions

## forEach, map, and filter
* forEach takes in a callBack, and it pass the array's element and do something with it, returns undefined and usally used for sideEffects
* filter takes in a callBack and returns an newArray. newArray's element's value is the ones from the ogArray that when get passed to the callBack, it returns true
* map takes in a callBack and returns an newArray. newArray's element's value is the result of the element from the ogArray when get passed to the callBack
* map takes an array, takes a callback, loop through the array, apply the callback on each element during the loop, and return the result in an array. [reuslt, result, result, result]
* filter takes an array, takes a callback, loop through the array, apply the callback on each element during the loop, and return the result in an array where the return is true when you apply the cal back on each element 
* forEach takes an array, taeks a callback, loop through the array, apply the callback on each element during the loop and return undefined

## arrow function
* syntax input => function
* think of it as taking the input into the function operation

### Mental notes
* sometimes get up and do something else and let your thoughts sink in 
* if you dont get something, shift your attention to other stuff and ask for help

### What is JavaSCript 
* JS is a programming language used mainly for web dev
* Languages are for communication (to comminacate with the computer)
  * Question, inquries, command
* JS treats everything as a value (what does that mean?)
* What does it mean to treat a `Function` as a value
* JS values can be stored in `variables`

### Function in JavaScript
* Usually in JS, function takes 0 to n input, and return 1 output
* variables are js memory of something, you can replace the memory as you see fit
* when you first declare a function, js store it, when you call it then it gets invoked in js memory (pointing to a lightswitch and using the lightswitch)
* In js, you can refer to a function without running it  
* reference of a function is important because you can give your reference to someone (some function) else and have them use it
* difference between TELLING someone about an action and ACTUALLLY performing the function
* callback and higher order function exists to solve problems that JS was designed to solve 
* JS store variable in a box, the box can have value, function, or memory address of an object or array. You can change things inside the box by resassinging them
* functions are values, just like boolean an array
* Treat functions as any other values 
* ```js
  const sayHello = () => {
    console.log('hello');
  }
  const greeting = sayHello; //passing the reference of the function sayHello to greeting
  //greeting now have the sane value as sayHello, so when you call greeting its like calling sayHello
  //the absence of () makes passing reference of function possible
* ```
* This allows you to write one line of generic code and do different things depending on the situations
* when you write a higher order function that receives a callBack, you should write a command just so that you have a heads up that you are expecting a call back and gonna do something with it
* Higher order function should returns the callBack, espiecally if you are expecting to return what the callBAck is gonna give you
