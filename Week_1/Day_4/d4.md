## Summary

1) functions can be referneced and passed as arguments when invoking other functions
2) Functions can be stored in variables and passed around
3) Functions can do everything that other objects can do (having properties assigned to them)
4) When looping through an object, no matter what you do, you cant do obj.anPropertyThatDoesntExist, you will just get undefined, if you want to assing it to something that ypou have to do obj[nowTheresAProperty]
```javascript
const myFn = function() {
  console.log("I am function.");
}

myFn.someAttribute = 42;
console.log(myFn.someAttribute);

function runner(f) {
  f();
}

runner(myFn);
```
* We assign a function to our variable `myFn`
* An attribute `someAttribute` is assigned to that function object
* A `runner` function is defined that runs the argument f that we pass it 
* We pass reference to our `myFn`, which gets invoked by the runner function
1) if you assign an attribute to a function, then the function's value (without invoking) will me `[Function: myFn] { someATtribute: value}`

### Call back functions
* is a function passed (by reference) into another function (recevier function)
* The recevier function is accepting behaviour to perform by calling the callback function that is now has access to
* The receiver function can decide to call the callback function at anytime, as many times as it wants
* you can use receive and call back when you have an action that does something you want and you wanna call it inself the receiver function, but then you dont want to define it inside the receiver
* When you use callback, you are passing a reference to the function as the arugment, the argument is known as callback function
* Callback gets defined, passed as an argument, then execute when a specific event occurs inside the receiver
* Callback always return undefined, typically you used it to execute side effects
* you cant break or stop out of a forEach unless its an error
* Passing callback allows us to pass on behvaiours into other functions
```javascript
const findWaldo = function(names, found) {
  names.forEach((name, index)=>{
    if (name === 'Waldo') {
      found(index);
    }
  });
};

findWaldo(["Alice", "Bob", "Waldo", "Winston"], (index) => {
  console.log(`Found Waldo at index ${index}`);
});
```
* Here, you are having a function that `expects a callback`, and it gets the callback when you call the function at line 47
* when it was written, it was probably under some logic like "if under certain events, do something", then do someting will be hanlde by the callback
* `anoymous functions` is not named or assigned to a variable, it only exist and invoked when calling the receiver function

## Arrow Functions
```javascript
[1,2,3].forEach(num => console.log('num: ', num));
```
* For oneline, you dont need bracket and curly barcket
* There is no this in arrow functions
