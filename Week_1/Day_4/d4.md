## Summary

1) functions can be referneced and passed as arguments when invoking other functions
2) Functions can be stored in variables and passed around
3) Functions can do everything that other objects can do (having properties assigned to them)
4) When looping through an object, no matter what you do, you cant do obj.anPropertyThatDoesntExist, you will just get undefined, if you want to assing it to something that ypou have to do obj[nowTheresAProperty]
```javascript
const myFn = function() {
  console.log("I am function.");
}

myFn.someAttribute = 42;
console.log(myFn.someAttribute);

function runner(f) {
  f();
}

runner(myFn);
```
* We assign a function to our variable `myFn`
* An attribute `someAttribute` is assigned to that function object
* A `runner` function is defined that runs the argument f that we pass it 
* We pass reference to our `myFn`, which gets invoked by the runner function
1) if you assign an attribute to a function, then the function's value (without invoking) will me `[Function: myFn] { someATtribute: value}`

### Call back functions
* is a function passed (by reference) into another function (recevier function)
* The recevier function is accepting behaviour to perform by calling the callback function that is now has access to
* The receiver function can decide to call the callback function at anytime, as many times as it wants
* you can use receive and call back when you have an action that does something you want and you wanna call it inself the receiver function, but then you dont want to define it inside the receiver
* When you use callback, you are passing a reference to the function as the arugment, the argument is known as callback function
* Callback gets defined, passed as an argument, then execute when a specific event occurs inside the receiver
* Callback always return undefined, typically you used it to execute side effects
* you cant break or stop out of a forEach unless its an error
* Passing callback allows us to pass on behvaiours into other functions
```javascript
const findWaldo = function(names, found) {
  names.forEach((name, index)=>{
    if (name === 'Waldo') {
      found(index);
    }
  });
};

findWaldo(["Alice", "Bob", "Waldo", "Winston"], (index) => {
  console.log(`Found Waldo at index ${index}`);
});
```
* Here, you are having a function that `expects a callback`, and it gets the callback when you call the function at line 47
* when it was written, it was probably under some logic like "if under certain events, do something", then do someting will be hanlde by the callback
* `anoymous functions` is not named or assigned to a variable, it only exist and invoked when calling the receiver function

## Arrow Functions
```javascript
[1,2,3].forEach(num => console.log('num: ', num));
```
* For oneline, you dont need bracket and curly barcket
* There is no this in arrow functions

## Higher Order Function
* Functions that take in callbacks are referred to as Higher Order Functions
* Higher-Order functions are any functions which operate on other functions.
* forEach, filter are higher order functions because they operate on the annymous function ` () => ` you passed on 
* Higher-order functions is a major part of `Functional Programming`

## Why Functional Programming
* Less Bugs
  * Easier to reason about
* Less time
  * Re-use more 
* Higher Order Functions are good for composition 
* The fact that we can take one function and put it in another function allow us to compose a lot of smaller functions into a bigger functios 
* reject does the opposite of filter
* You are allow to think and reason and debug seperate functions  because they are higher order functions

## forEach, map, and filter
* forEach takes in a callBack, and it pass the array's element and do something with it, returns undefined and usally used for sideEffects
* filter takes in a callBack and returns an newArray. newArray's element's value is the ones from the ogArray that when get passed to the callBack, it returns true
* map takes in a callBack and returns an newArray. newArray's element's value is the result of the element from the ogArray when get passed to the callBack
* map takes an array, takes a callback, loop through the array, apply the callback on each element during the loop, and return the result in an array. [reuslt, result, result, result]
* filter takes an array, takes a callback, loop through the array, apply the callback on each element during the loop, and return the result in an array where the return is true when you apply the cal back on each element 
* forEach takes an array, taeks a callback, loop through the array, apply the callback on each element during the loop and return undefined

## arrow function
* syntax input => function
* think of it as taking the input into the function operation

## Lecture Notes - First Half

### Mental notes
* sometimes get up and do something else and let your thoughts sink in 
* if you dont get something, shift your attention to other stuff and ask for help

### What is JavaSCript 
* JS is a programming language used mainly for web dev
* Languages are for communication (to comminacate with the computer)
  * Question, inquries, command
* JS treats everything as a value (what does that mean?)
* What does it mean to treat a `Function` as a value
* JS values can be stored in `variables`

### Function in JavaScript
* Usually in JS, function takes 0 to n input, and return 1 output
* variables are js memory of something, you can replace the memory as you see fit
* when you first declare a function, js store it, when you call it then it gets invoked in js memory (pointing to a lightswitch and using the lightswitch)
* In js, you can refer to a function without running it  
* reference of a function is important because you can give your reference to someone (some function) else and have them use it
* difference between TELLING someone about an action and ACTUALLLY performing the function
* callback and higher order function exists to solve problems that JS was designed to solve 
* JS store variable in a box, the box can have value, function, or memory address of an object or array. You can change things inside the box by resassinging them
* functions are values, just like boolean an array
* Treat functions as any other values 
* ```js
  const sayHello = () => {
    console.log('hello');
  }
  const greeting = sayHello; //passing the reference of the function sayHello to greeting
  //greeting now have the sane value as sayHello, so when you call greeting its like calling sayHello
  //the absence of () makes passing reference of function possible
* ```
* This allows you to write one line of generic code and do different things depending on the situations
* when you write a higher order function that receives a callBack, you should write a command just so that you have a heads up that you are expecting a call back and gonna do something with it
* Higher order function should returns the callBack, espiecally if you are expecting to return what the callBAck is gonna give you
---
## Lecture Notes - Second Half
* callBacks and pattern and result of the fact that functions are value
* callBacks solve functionality 
* whenever you have a function that takes an into a dynamically function injection, thats probably a place for callBack
* you hand over the control of the callBack functions to the recevier functions (higher order functions)
* annoymous function: delcare the functions and its functionaitliy wihtout giving it a name
* Kinda similar to 
* ```js
  let num = 2
  console.log(num) //non annoymous, you defined what num is, and you pass it as a parameter to the function console.log
  //annoymous
  console.log(2) //you define your parameter at the time you call console.log and pass it to console.log 
* ```
* Callbacks mainly solve:
  * duplication
  * injecting our code somewhere else 
  * when you learn an library, and theres a function you want to use in which you are not allowed to change whats inside, the developer might have given you a change to put a callBack inside the function 
* So if you can `identify exactly where for which functions is being duplicated`, you can use a callBack
* callback allows you to be expressive
* When a function is generic and it waits for more functionality, you can extract that set of functionality and replace it as a placeholder in your parameters when you design the function

## Object iteration
```js

// when you traverse over an object. if you do
obj.Item
// and the obj doesnt have a key called specifically Item, you will always get undefined
//when you use 
for (let key in obj)
//to tranverse an obj
//you cant just do obj.key for that reason, unless obj has a key called key inside it 
//you will have to do
obj[key] // in this case
//if the value of the key in obj is object, then you will have to get it by 
obj[key].something //or
obj[key]['something']
//also you have to rememebr the fact that when you use for.. in to traverse an object, the key is a string, because keys in object are string, so you cant use the key to get the value of the key 

```
---
* Sort() modifies the orignial array while filter and map returns an new array 

## this keyword
* this is a reference to an object 
* so if you define an object group, and within it you do this === group it will return true
* in an arrow function, the this keyword is a refernece to the object in which the arrow function is called
* in a traditionally defined function, the this keyword is a reference to the object in which the function is defined

## Closure
* In JS a function has access to
  1) variables in its own context
  2) varaibles in the contexts of all parent function 
  3) global variables 
* The key attribute of clousres is that the `inner` function accesses variable that is defined with in the parent function
* Lexical Scoping means that it retain references to any variables in parent functions 
* Being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope is called closure
* A function that references bindings from local scopes around it is called a closure 
* you can think of clousr conatins both the code in their body and the environment in which they are created, and when called, the function body see the enviornment in which it was created
* The inner function is returned from the outer function before being exewcuted 
* A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared
* 
```js
  const multiplier(factor) => {
    return number => number * factor; 
    //returns an annoymous function that takes in a parameter number, and times the number with factor
  }
  let twice = multiplier(2);
  // here, first multiplier is called and creates an envornment in which that factor is bound to 2
  //multipllier returns an annoymous function that takes in a parameter (number), and times the number with the factor
  //which is stored in twice
  //twice, rememebring this environment, and having the annon functions to its disposal
  //when called twice(num) will do num * 2 (factor)
  const wrapValue(n){
    let local = n;
    return () => local;
  }
  let wrap1 = wrapValue(1);
  //wrap1() will equal to 1
  // here, wrapValue is called and creates an enviornment in which local is equaled to n, the parameters that it takes
  //then it returns an annon functions that returns local
  //wrap1 rememebrs the enviornment wrap value was created in, and it also has the annon function that returns local when it is created 
  //so when wrap1 is called by wrap1(), it will return local when it was created, being 1

  //another example 
  function makeAdder(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
    };
  }

  var add5 = makeAdder(5);
  var add10 = makeAdder(10);

  console.log(add5(2));  // 7
  console.log(add10(2)); // 12
  /*
  makeAdder(x) takes in an arguemnt x and returns a new function
  the functio it returns take a sinalge arugemnt y and returns the sum of x and y, x being the argument makeAdder takes in
  makeAdder can be look as a function factory because when you call it, it creates and return a function which can add a specific value (being x) to their argument (being y)
` add5 and add10 are both closures , they share the same function body definition but store different lexical enviornments 
  */

```

## Immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE)
* You can alternatively use an immediately invoked function expression to acheive a similar result
```js
const foo = (function() {
  const x = 10;

  const inner = function() {
    console.log("Value of x is: " + x);
  }
  return inner;
})();
foo();
//(); at the end immediately invoke foo, which will assigned the returned value (inner) to foo
```

## Argument Object and Rest Parameters
``` js

//in js , traditinoally defined function has access to an object 
arguments

//which if you define a function, for example 

function func1(a,b,c)

arguments[b] //will retrun whatever you put in b in the funciton func1

//arrow function does not have access to this arguments objct tho, but you can use a rest parameters ... to do it 

const func1 = (...abc) => {

}

//in this caes you are basically expecting an infinite numbers of arguments 
//also this rest parameters put all your arguments in an array 

```
