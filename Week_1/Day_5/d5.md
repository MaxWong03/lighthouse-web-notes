# Day 5 Notes

## General Mental Notes
* A well-rounded developer go deeper into `the stack` to understand how things work behind the scenes
* They work to understand the `why ` behind a solution
* They work on their `ability` to `research`, `analyze`, `reflect` and `write` about interesting topcis 


## What to Study and Why
* `Small cdoing challenges` - they are commonly used by companies as technical interivew questions. Practicing these makes you a `better` and `more hirable` developer 
* `Computer Science` - Aim towards being inspired to self-learn CS topcis. Many employers incorporate CS questions into their interview process. The goal with CS is to be `aware` of these topics, `realize` their importance and the fact that they are `not intimidating` to learn  

## Research, Analyse, Reflect, and Write
* Software development `isn't` just about writing code
* A `good` software developer `can` objectively `research` and `bring insight` to the team or larger community 
* Try to build the `confidence` and `habit` of blogging about topics that you are interested in
* `A good blog` works well when it comes to `job research`

## Rubber Duck Debugging
* The simple act of having to `explain` often `help us find and fix` our issue
* In `describing` what the code is `supposed to do` and `observing` what it `actually does`, any incongruity between these two `(what is supposed to do and what it actually does)` becomes apparent 
* At some point you will say `what you are doing next` and `realise` that is `not` in fact `what you are actually doing`

## Troubleshooting Guide 
### Before you call yourself stuck, ask yourself the following quesiton:
### Have I ...
1) `Pseudo-coded` the solution
2) `googled the error message` I am getting 
3) `actually READ` the error message
4) `double-checked` my syntax
5) `linted` my code
6) `pair programmed` or gotten a peer to `code review`
7) `rubber-ducked` the problem
  If you done 1-7, then you have done your due diligence and should be calling a mentor over 

## Recursion
* Recursion is an alternative to traditional looping 
* `Any` problem that you can solve with a `for loop`, you `can` solve with `recursion, and `vice versa`
* Recursive function `calls itself until it doesn't`
* Like a loop, a recursive function `execute code over and over again` and it has to `stop calling itself at some point`
``` js
function countEvenToTwelve(number) {
   if (number <= 12) { //recursive case, keep running as long as this is true (recurse)
     console.log(number);
     countEvenToTwelve(number+2);
   }//else if num > 12 , stop running (base case), do nothing when number > 12 
 }
 countEvenToTwelve(0);
```
* `As long as number <= 12`, the function `continues` to `call itself` to `repeat the code over and over again`
* `As soon as number > 12`, the function `stops calling itself` and the "looping" `ends`
* Each time `countEvenToTwelve` `calls itself`, it `passes in a different input value`
* In this case, number will be 2 more than it was last time `(n-1)` each time the function is called
* Recursive function `calls itself` with a `modified input parameter`
* Its important the parameter is modified becuase you want it to stop at some value
* `number <= 12` is a `recursive case`, because `as long as this is true`, the function will `continue to call itself`
* `number > 12` is a `base aase`, because if this is `true`, the function `will not call itself`
``` js
function countUpFrom(number) {
  console.log(number);
  countUpFrom(number+1);
}
countUpFrom(1);
```
* The above code `never stop calling itself`, because `it doesnt have a if statement to catch the modification of the input parameters`
* Every time the function calls itself (`recursive case`), the `input gets closer and closer to the base case`
* A `properly designed` recursive function `must` gradually `resolve towards the base case with each recursive call` 
* A function must have `at least one recursive case` and `at least one base case` in order to be recursive

### Recursive Conclusion
* Recursion is a `tool` you can use as an `alternative` to traditional iteration using `for` and `while` loops
* Every `recursive` function `must` have a `base case` and a `recursive case`
* `Each` recursive `call` should `break down` the current problem into a `smaller`, simpler one 
* The `base case` is when the problem can be `solved without further recursion`
