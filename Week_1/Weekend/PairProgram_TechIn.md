# Pair Programming
* Share knowledge, and everyone benefits and the group succeeds
* `Navigator` considers the `strageic` direcion of work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address
* Pair program with an `open mind` and take into consideration what the other person has to offer 
* The best programmer are `good listners`
* Treat the findal product as a `shared creation`, the point is to learn from each toher and work towards a `common goal`
* Start with samll steps and move towards the larger idea 
* If you are confused, just ask. If you are ceratin, explain.
* The idea is to `learn` from your partner and `teach` them what you know
* When you are the `Driver`, it is extremely `important` that you are `talking` about your code as you `write` it. This allows your Navigator to`follow` along
* When you are the `Navigator`, you are `providing` feed back, `reviewing` each line of code for errors, and consdiering the `strategic` direcion of the work

# Plagiarism
* When pair programming parts of a project submission with your peers, provide their `names` and `outline` which parts were paired
* @mentioning their github username in the `commit message`
__Ex:__
* Implementing automated tests (work in progress). 1hr spent so far, maybe 1hr more to go. Pairing with @kvirani

# Tech Interviews
* They are meant to assess you on points including
  1) `technical knowedlge`
  2) how `articulate` you are
  3) how `personable` you are
  4) how weel you can `explain` and `analyse` things
* Tech interviews `are not always about getting the right answer`, the more important part is often how we `reach and answer` and our `ability to think creatively`

## Process of a typical tech interview
1) `algorithm` and `coding problems` will form the largest component of tech interview
2) You are being `evaluted` on your `ability to apply exisitng knowledge` and `understanding` to `tackle` a problem that you `may not have seen before`
3) You will be asked to `explain` a `concept` or `analyze/debug` exisiting code

## Points of evaulation
1) `Coding Skill`
2) `Problem solving ability`
3) `Ability to think creatively`
4) `Communication skills`
5) `Analytical thinking skills`
6) Ability to solve problems in a `structured` and `systemtic` way
7) How you `handle feedback`

## Tips
1) `Think out loud` 
   * `Thought process` is an improtant part of your answer, it demonstrates you have an undestanding of the concepts being discussed
2) Its __OKAY__ to say `I dont know`
   * If you truly dont know how to answer a quesiton, it looks better to `acknowledge` that you arent sure and ask if you can still give it your `best shot` with the knowedlge you have. `Confidence` is key, but a `willingness to admit` your weakness and express your `desire` to improve can go a long way
3) `Ask Questions`
   * If a question is a little confusing or you feel you need `additional information`, its acceptable to `ask` the interviewer to `clarify`.
   * You may find that a quesiton that stumps you initially will be no problem with a little more information
   * Interviers oftne present vague questinos to see how `investigative` a potential hire is, and if they `ask` good `clarification questions`
