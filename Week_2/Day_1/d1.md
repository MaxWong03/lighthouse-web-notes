# Lecture Notes

## Modules
* There are 2 ways of using module
  1) `module.exports` and `require` - Common JS Syntax
  2) ES6 syntax (more on week 7)

## npm install
* npm install looks at the `package.json` file and install all `dependencies` 

## npm init
* `version` is very `important` for any pacakges
* `entry point` is the file that runs when you do `npm start`

## node_modules
* contains `all` dependencies `pacakges`
* dont commit it, because all the pacakges in node_modules are in npm already

## gitignore
* create a `.gitignore` file
* put your file inside the file

## Dependency 
* `Dev Dependency` is the code that we use to develop our code, not actually require to run the app (--save-dev)
* `Dependency` is the code that is `actually required` to run our code (--save)

## Git Flow (best practice)
1) git add
2) git status (tells you files that has been changed in your project)
3) git diff (tells you whats different in the files that has been changed)
4) git commit 

## Git things
* Once you `git init` in the `root folder` of your project, you dont have to git init into the `childern` folders


## Javascript things
* array.slice() `return` a shallow copy of the array
* array.splice() `modify` the original array
