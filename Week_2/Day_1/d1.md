# Lecture Notes

## Modules
* There are 2 ways of using module
  1) `module.exports` and `require` - Common JS Syntax
  2) ES6 syntax (more on week 7)
  3) Using Libraries let you push some complexity over to the libraries to handle

---

## Export and Require
``` js
// importing multiple functions
module.exports = {
  myFunction1: myFunction1 //you could rename this on the left side
  myFunction2: myFunction2 
}

//requiring multiple functions
//lets say our library is called myLib
const function1 = require('./myLib').myFunction1
const function2 = require('./myLib').myFunction2
//the above shows that the return value of export is indeed an object
//and to get the function we want from a library is similar to access key value pair with an object 

```
---
## npm install
* npm install looks at the `package.json` file and install all `dependencies` 

## npm init
* `version` is very `important` for any pacakges
* `entry point` is the file that runs when you do `npm start`
---
## node_modules
* contains `all` dependencies `pacakges`
* dont commit it, because all the pacakges in node_modules are in npm already

---
## Dependency 
* `Dev Dependency` is the code that we use to develop our code, not actually require to run the app (--save-dev)
* `Dependency` is the code that is `actually required` to run our code (--save)
---
## Work Flow
* Describe a `group` of test
* Make one `small changes`, and `test` it
* put all your test in a folder called `test`, and all your javascript file in a folder called `src`
---
## Testing
* Your testing `input` should be `simple`
* The `input` should be a `representative` of how the function should work (behaviour)
---
## Git Flow (best practice)
1) git add
2) git status (tells you files that has been changed in your project)
3) git diff (tells you whats different in the files that has been changed, since last commit)
4) git commit 

## Git things
* Once you `git init` in the `root folder` of your project, you dont have to git init into the `childern` folders
* if you rename things you have to do `git mv`, otherwise git will create another file on remote repo
* if you move things you need to do `git add`, otherwise git will create another file on remote repo

## gitignore
* create a `.gitignore` file
* put your file inside the file

---

## Javascript things
* array.slice() `return` a shallow copy of the array
* array.splice() `modify` the original array
``` js
//eslint-disable-line to disable linting on a specific line

/*eslint-disable */
// block of code that you dont want linting
/*eslint-enable */

```

### Destructing
``` js
//This is more for objects related stuff
//lets say you have two functions you want to import
const {function1, function2} = require('./mylib');
//general
const obj = {a:1, b:2, c:3};
const {a,c} = obj; //getting getting value of key a and value of key c 
```

### Property Value Shorthand
```js
let cat = 'Miaow';
let dog = 'Woof';
let bird = 'Peet peet';

let someObject = {
  cat,
  dog,
  bird
}
//{
//  cat: "Miaow",
//  dog: "Woof",
//  bird: "Peet peet"
//}
```
