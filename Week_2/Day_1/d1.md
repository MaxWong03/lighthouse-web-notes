# Lecture Notes

## Modules
* There are 2 ways of using module
  1) `module.exports` and `require` - Common JS Syntax
  2) ES6 syntax (more on week 7)

## npm install
* npm install looks at the `package.json` file and install all `dependencies` 

## npm init
* `version` is very `important` for any pacakges
* `entry point` is the file that runs when you do `npm start`

## node_modules
* contains `all` dependencies `pacakges`
* dont commit it, because all the pacakges in node_modules are in npm already

## gitignore
* create a `.gitignore` file
* put your file inside the file

## Dependency 
* `Dev Dependency` is the code that we use to develop our code, not actually require to run the app (--save-dev)
* `Dependency` is the code that is `actually required` to run our code (--save)

## Git Flow
1) git add
2) git status (tells you things that has been change since the last time you commit)
3) git commit 

## Git things
* Once you `git init` in the `root folder` of your project, you dont have to git init into the `childern` folders


## Javascript things
* array.slice() `return` a shallow copy of the array
* array.splice() `modify` the original array
