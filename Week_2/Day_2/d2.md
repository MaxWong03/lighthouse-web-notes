# Asynchronous Programming
* Asynchronous Programming is when a `unit of work` is run `separately` from the `main thread` of the program and `notifies` the program of its `completetion`

## setTimeout
* setTimeout is used to `delay` the `execution` of some code to later. We specify the code via `callback`, and the delay in ms
* a `callback` is `passed` in to setTimeout and setTimeout `calls` it `after` x ms
* It is used on many websites to delay a message or response

# Lecture Notes
## Async Control Flow
* `Async function` (actions) **recevies a callback**, when the async function is `finished` **it uses the callback to perform an action**
* When you have something you want to do `after` the `async` function is done, you pass it a `callBack`
* Because the `purpose` of a `callback` is to have it `called` so you can `do` `something` with it `later`
* Callback is `passed`, and `called` later on for use, so its perfect for async control flow
