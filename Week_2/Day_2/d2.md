# Asynchronous Programming
* Asynchronous Programming is when a `unit of work` is run `separately` from the `main thread` of the program and `notifies` the program of its `completetion`

## setTimeout
* setTimeout is used to `delay` the `execution` of some code to later. We specify the code via `callback`, and the delay in ms
* a `callback` is `passed` in to setTimeout and setTimeout `calls` it `after` x ms
* It is used on many websites to delay a message or response

## User Events
* Since user `events` can occur `any time` while our app is running, we need to be able to `handle` them `asynchronously`
* `on` function is a very common method name for registering callbacks to handle events.
* `on` returns `immediately`, `without running the callback code`
* It saves the callback and run the callback for later

## Testing Async functions
* With mocha, simply put done inside the callback and when the async function you test finishes, type in done()

## Networking
* A network is when 2 or more computers are connected and can communicate with each other

### TCP
* Transmission Control Protocol, provides a standard that allows machines to speak to each other
* TCP `allows` two machines to `establish` an `open channel` for `two-way` data communication that `allows` `sending` and `receiving` data until one of them decides to `terminate` the `connection`
* An `IP Address` is needed to `specify` what connection to `establish`
* `Ports` are `IP Address`'s extension
* `NIC (Network Interface Card` is like the `mouth` and `ear` of the computer

# Lecture Notes
## Async Control Flow
* `Async function` (actions) **recevies a callback**, when the async function is `finished` **it uses the callback to perform an action**
* When you have something you want to do `after` the `async` function is done, you pass it a `callBack`
* Because the `purpose` of a `callback` is to have it `called` so you can `do` `something` with it `later`
* Callback is `passed`, and `called` later on for use, so its perfect for async control flow

## Javasciprt thing
* `\u003` is the key code for control c
