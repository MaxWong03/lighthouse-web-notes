## Net
* `Net` is a module that allows our Node apps to use TCP
  
**Sample Client Server Code**

**Server**
``` js
const net = require('net'); //requiring the net package
//creating the server
const server = net.createServer();
server.on('connection', (client) => {
  console.log('New client connected!');
  client.write('Hello there!');
  /*
  im guessing this is listening on a connection
  and when there is a connection, the call back is invoked passing the client as the parameter
  which then prints out New client ocnnected
  the client here is an object, in which the callback use the write method to pass the Hello there to the client
  */
 client.setEncoding('utf8');
  client.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log('Message from client: ', data);
  });
  /*
    when theres a connection (server.on), listen to if client send a data, and if it does, call back is invoked resulting in console.log
  */
});
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000!');
});
```
**Client**
``` js
const net = require('net'); //requiring the net package
//settig up the connection
const conn = net.createConnection({
  host: 'Server IP Address Here', //ip address of the host
  port: 3000 //notice the port is the same as the one server is listening to
});
conn.setEncoding('utf8');//this will intepret data from the connection it is getting (server) as text instead of char code
conn.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log('Server says: ', data);
  /*
  I am guessing the the client here is listening on the connection for incoming data, and when it does receive incoming data it invokes the callback and console.log the data
  */
});
conn.on('connect', () => {
  conn.write('Hello from client!');
  //listening on the connection and when it does connect, send the data hello from client to the connection (being the server)
});
```
**You could also write the connection an function**
``` js 
const net = require('net');
const connect = () => {
  const conn = net.createConnection({
    host: '192.168.88.123',
    port: 50541
  });
  const.setEncoding('utf8');
  conn.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log('Server says: ', data);
  });
  return conn;
  //the conn object return here allow you to talk to the server
};
```
* Node will wait until `all active` TCP connections are `terminated`
* TCP is `Language Agnostic`
* The `client` is the one **establishing the connection** to the `server`
* All the `client` needs is the `destination IP` and `PORT` info
* TCP `Guarantees` order, message will `arrive` in the `order` they were `sent`
