# Lecture Notes
> Node has a lot of built in packages that you can utilize to do lot of things 

## What is Networking?
* Communication between machines on a network 
## What is a Protocol?
* A defined standard for how `requests` and `responses` are sent between network devices
---
## Net
* `Net` is a module that allows our Node apps to use TCP
  
**Sample Client Server Code**

**Server**
``` js
const net = require('net'); //requiring the net package
//creating the server
const server = net.createServer();
server.on('connection', (client) => {
  console.log('New client connected!');
  client.write('Hello there!');
  /*
  im guessing this is listening on a connection
  and when there is a connection, the call back is invoked passing the client as the parameter
  which then prints out New client ocnnected
  the client here is an object, in which the callback use the write method to pass the Hello there to the client
  */
 client.setEncoding('utf8');
  client.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log('Message from client: ', data);
  });
  /*
    when theres a connection (server.on), listen to if client send a data, and if it does, call back is invoked resulting in console.log
  */
});
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000!');
});
```
**Client**
``` js
const net = require('net'); //requiring the net package
//settig up the connection
const conn = net.createConnection({
  host: 'Server IP Address Here', //ip address of the host
  port: 3000 //notice the port is the same as the one server is listening to
});
conn.setEncoding('utf8');//this will intepret data from the connection it is getting (server) as text instead of char code
conn.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log('Server says: ', data);
  /*
  I am guessing the the client here is listening on the connection for incoming data, and when it does receive incoming data it invokes the callback and console.log the data
  */
});
conn.on('connect', () => {
  conn.write('Hello from client!');
  //listening on the connection and when it does connect, send the data hello from client to the connection (being the server)
});
```
**You could also write the connection an function**
``` js 
const net = require('net');
const connect = () => {
  const conn = net.createConnection({
    host: '192.168.88.123',
    port: 50541
  });
  const.setEncoding('utf8');
  conn.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log('Server says: ', data);
  });
  return conn;
  //the conn object return here allow you to talk to the server
};
```
* Node will wait until `all active` TCP connections are `terminated`
* TCP is `Language Agnostic`
* The `client` is the one **establishing the connection** to the `server`
* All the `client` needs is the `destination IP` and `PORT` info
* TCP `Guarantees` order, message will `arrive` in the `order` they were `sent`
---
## HTTP
* Hypter-Text Transfer Protocol
* Works on top of `TCP`
* `Request` / `Response` system
* `Stateless` - no memory of previous communication
* `Routes` are made of `2` things: `METHOD/VERB` and `PATH`
* `Path`: www.facebook.com/**my-page**
* `Method`: **GET**(how you request/get information), **POST** (how you send information), **PUT** (create data in database), **PATCH** (update data in database), **DELETE** (delete data in database)
* `Reuest` is made up of `header` (origin destination, where cookies are sent) and `body` (not used in GET, but where POST info lives)
* `Responses`:
    1) `header`: origin destination, content-type, content length
    2) `body`: content
    3) `status code`: 200 (okay), 404 (resource not found), 500 (interal server error)
* **If you dont explicitly say what your status code is going to be, it will be implicitly done for you**
* Everything we do within the browser is **GET** and **POST**
* Every `response` comes with a `status code`
* Anything on the internet, if you can see it on your page, it lives inside your machine
* HTTP is the langauge that both client and server use to communicate over a TCP connection
### HTTP flow
**When a client wants to communicate with a server, it performs the following steps:**
1) `Open` a TCP `connection`
   * The TCP connection is used to `send` request(s) and `receive` an answer
2) `Send` an HTTP message
3) `Read` the response sent by the server
4) `Close` or `reuse` the connection for further reuqests

### Request and Response
* HTTP is a `request-response` based protocol
1) `Client` makes a `request` to an HTTP `server`
2) `Immediately` also `sending` a message `asking` for specific `resource`
3) `Server` sends down (the resource) as a `response`
* HTTP messages have __2__ format:
  1) `HTTP/1.1` (human-readable)
  2) `HTTP/2` (binary structure)
   

**There are two types of HTTP messages, request and responses**

**Request**
```
Get / HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
Accept-Language: fr
```
* **Get**: `Method` 
  * usually like `GET` (fetching a resource), `POST` (post the value of an HTML from) that `defines` the `operation` the `client` `wants`
* **/**: `Path` 
  * The path of the `resource to fetch`
* **1.1**: `Version of the Protocol`
* the rest is `Headers`
  * convey additional info `for` the server

**Responses**
```
Http/1.1 200 OK
Headers
```
* **HTTP/1.1**: `Version of the protocol`
  * The version of the HTTP protocol they follow
* **200**: `Status code`
  * A status code, `indicating` if the `request was successful, or not, and why`
* **OK**: `Status message`
  * A status message, a non-authoritative short `description` `of the status code`
* the rest is `Headers`
  * a body containing the `fetched` `resource`

### Structure of URL
* `Protocol` - indicate which protocol the browser must use. `mailto:` open a mail client, `ftp:` handle file transfer
* `Domain Name` - indicate which `Web server` is being `requested`
* `Port` - indicate the technical `gate` used to `access the resources on the web server`
* `Path` - path to the `resource` on the web server
* `Parameters` - list of `key/value pairs` `seperated` with the `&` symbol. Web server uses those parameters to do extra stuff `before returning the resource`
* `Anchor` - anchor to `another part` of the resource itself. Gives the browser the `directions` to show the content located at that bookmarked spot. For example, the browser will scroll to the point where the anchor is defined. On a video or audio document the browser will try to go to the time the anchor represents

## Command line things
> use cat file | grep string to serach for something inside a file

> use ls folder | grep file to search for a file inside a folder

> use telent IP PORT to test out if your server is set up correctly without writing client code with javascript


# Tech In Notes
* Be more `interactive`, ask more `questions`, so that they `remember` you and know they can `work with` you
* `Point out` even the `smallest things` (global variable, variable naming, function naming, return value)
* Function should return a value so that we can use it for more things in the future
* Function is good because we will have little codes that is all bug free
* comment is when you want to clarify your code
