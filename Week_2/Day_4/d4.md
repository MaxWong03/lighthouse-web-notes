# Lecture Notes

## Promises, Concurrency, and Async / Sync Operation
* Promises and call back are about solving problems of `concurrency`, dealing with `multi-users` and `request` at the same time
* If you run a `node (or JS) server` and your operation is `sync` you will end up `blocking` the **entire server because one operation has to be done before other operation can happen** 
* So you have as dev have to make a `decision` where to do sync operation and async operation

## Object Review
* Object has `state` and `behaviour`
* `state` is the key value pair
* `bheaviour` is the methods

## Promises
* `Promise` is an `object`
* We can `take` promise and `action it right away`, even tho its gonna take some time to go through and might have an error
* Promise has stage `Pending` and `FulFilled` (resolved)
* `then` is the method to `attach` callback to the promise, then is `built in` to all promises
* `then` will only trigger when the promise is `fulfilled`, if theres an `error` `then` wont be triggered
* Once a promise is `resolved`, the promise will `change` to  what the `value` the promise is fulfilled to
* If you chain `then`, the `return value` of the `above level then` will get `passed as the parameter` in the `then`'s `callback` `below`




## JSON
``` js
JSON.parse() //from JSON to JS
JSON.stringify() //from JS to JSON

const jsonString = '{"a":1, "b":2, "foo":"bar"}'
JSON.parse(jsonString) = { a: 1, b: 2, foo: 'bar' }
delete obj.foo;
JSON.stringify(obj) = '{"a":1,"b":2}'
```
* JSON is LAnguage Independent

## API
* API are sets of requirements that govern how one application can talk to another
* Allows one software to talk to another
* `Best practice` is to make the data in the `body` of the request
