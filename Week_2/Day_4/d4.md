# Lecture Notes

## Promises, Concurrency, and Async / Sync Operation
* Promises and call back are about solving problems of `concurrency`, dealing with `multi-users` and `request` at the same time
* If you run a `node (or JS) server` and your operation is `sync` you will end up `blocking` the **entire server because one operation has to be done before other operation can happen** 
* So you have as dev have to make a `decision` where to do sync operation and async operation

## Object Review
* Object has `state` and `behaviour`
* `state` is the key value pair
* `bheaviour` is the methods

## Promises
* `Promise` is an `object`
* We can `take` promise and `action it right away`, even tho its gonna take some time to go through and might have an error
* Promise has stage `Pending`, `FulFilled` (resolved), `Rejected`
* `then` is the method to `attach` callback to the promise, then is `built in` to all promises
* `then` will only trigger when the promise is `fulfilled`, if theres an `error` `then` wont be triggered
* Once a promise is `resolved`, the promise will `change` to  what the `value` the promise is fulfilled to
* If you chain `then`, the `return value` of the `above level then` will get `passed as the parameter` in the `then`'s `callback` `below`
* The chained `then` runs synchrously
* A promise `represents` the `state` of a task, when the task is `completed`, the promise is `updated` to `fulfilled`
* `.then` returns a new promise 
* If you `return` a `promise` inside a `promise` callback, the return value is actaully the `pending promise of the promise in the return statement` which you then **can do .then and wait for the returned pending promise to fulfilled**
* **Utilizing the fact that chianed then is synchronusly and the return promise is a new pending promise, we can avoid call back hell and do async function in a sync way**
* You only need `one` `catch` because other `then` wont get triggered if theres a `rejected` promise
* checkout `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`

## Creating Promises
* the Promise `object` takes in a `call back`, with `resolve` and `reject` being the `parameters`, and both `resolve` and `reject` are `callback`


## JSON
``` js
JSON.parse() //from JSON to JS
JSON.stringify() //from JS to JSON

const jsonString = '{"a":1, "b":2, "foo":"bar"}'
JSON.parse(jsonString) = { a: 1, b: 2, foo: 'bar' }
delete obj.foo;
JSON.stringify(obj) = '{"a":1,"b":2}'
```
* JSON is LAnguage Independent

## API
* API are sets of requirements that govern how one application can talk to another
* Allows one software to talk to another
* `Best practice` is to make the data in the `body` of the request

## Promises
* A `promise` represents the `eventual results` of an `asynchronous` operation
* The primary way of `interaction` with a promise is through its `then` method
* The then method `registers` callbacks to `receive` either a promise's `eventual value` or the `reason why the promise can't be fulfilled`
* We `wrap` callback into a promise 
* Promise is `composable`
* Promise is an object which represents a `asynchronous` task that will `execute` and the `end result` of said task (fulfilled or rejected)
* We add `callback` to promise in order to `handle` the `end results` 
* then returns a `promise`!! very important when you are writing a function that uses promises 

## Writing Functions
* Sometimes before implemetning the functions, call it with inputs and callback just to see how you gonna use that function will help you implement it


## Writing Async Function
* Callback is a way to return data from async function and do something with it, so you have to include it in your function
* The call back allow greater flexbiltiy, once you have the data from the async you are gonna let the user decide how to handle the data via call back
* What the call back takes in, you have to design it when you are writing that async function
* Whatever you put in the callback during writing the async function, is the arugment you put in the call back when you use the function
