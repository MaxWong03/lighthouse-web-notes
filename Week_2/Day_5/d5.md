# Object Oriented Programming
* OO solves code organization. re-use and modularity
* In OO, we use `objects` to `group related variables` and `functions` together to keep our code more `organized` 
* An object is a little `bundle` of `infromation`, also known as `state`
* Each `property` of an object can `represent` the `state` of an object
* When an object's property's key value is a `function` (method), that is its `behaviour`
* The value of `this` is `determined` at the `time of the call` and depends on `how` and `where` it was called
> Whenever your method is accessing a property or another method on the same object, use this

* `Methods` (behvaiour)+ `Interal state` (non function key value) is what makes an object an object
* OO bundles together `state` and `logic` into object that can be represented as a `single` variable 

# Writing Functions
* Passing `objects` into `functions` so that `objects` are not `dependent` on `variables` `outside` of their own `scope`
* Creating functions that are more `independent` and more `portable` reduces the risk of functions accidentally `modifying` something you didnt mean to  

# Classes are BLUEPRINTS
* `Blueprint` is a `template` for `creating` a `new house` **(contains all details and instructions needed to build a house)**
* Blue print **IS NOT ** a house, but using it as a `guide` **we can create a new house as many as we want**
* Each house will be `unique` and `separated` from the other ones, but based on the `same blueprint`
* In OOP, `classes` are `blueprints` (templates) that we `use` to `create instances` of `objects`
* Class `describes` what the `object` is going to be and we can `create` new object using `class`

# Creating Class
* Class name should always be a `noun` and the `first letter` should always be `capitalized`
* **When you create an object using a class**, it is an `instance` of that class
* Using classes is a way of `simplying` the `creation` of `objects` that `share the same set` of `behaviour` and `properties`

``` js
class ChineseFood {
  constructor(){ //this are the things you put in to have every instances of ChineseFood object have certain properties
    this.ingredients = ['onion'];
    //the constructor set up the ingredients array and add onion as its first
  }
  addIngredients(ingre) {
    this.ingredients.push(ingre);
  }

}

let chowMein = new ChineseFood();
let friedRice = new ChineseFood();
```

* here `class` is `chinese food`, **the blue print to build chinese food object**
* chowMein and friedRice is an `instances` of the `chineseFood class`
* they are both objects, but completely `separate` ones
* Every chineseFood object (instances of chineseFood) will have `their OWN version of these PROPERTIES and METHODS`
* this means we can call the addIngredients method on chowMein without affecting friedRice
* `methods of class` (chineseFood) will `exist` on the `instances` created from the class, but `not` on the `class` `itself`
* if you try to access the instance of an object with a property name that is not there, it will return undefined, just like any other object
* instances of an object behaves just like object 

## Constructor
* the constructor `method` gets `executed` when an object `instace is created` from a class
* when we call new ChineseFood(), everything inside the constructor will get run for the new instance 
* Constructor is a `great` place to `set up default state for new instance` (setting default values for any new object's properties)

# Inheritance
* Inheritance **further organize** `behaviour` that is `common` between `multiple classes`

``` js 
class Student {
  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name; //creating property name and bind it to name
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact; //creating property quirkyFact and bind it to quirkyFact
  }
  enroll(cohort) {
    this.cohort = cohort; //creating a new property cohort
  }
  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`; //method that returns a string
  }
}

class Mentor {
  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
  }
  goOnShift() {
    this.onShift = true;
  }
  goOffShift() {
    this.onShift = false;
  }
  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here\`s my quirty fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}
```
* Student and mentor have `identical` **constructor and bio methods**
* They also share some `properties` (name and quirky fact)
* Using `Inheritance`, we can move the `shared code` into `another class`
* With `Inheritance`, we can build a new class `based on an existing class`
* Classes can inherit behaviour from other classes using the extends keyword
* A Class that is only inhereited from and never instanitated directly is called an ansbtract class
  
``` js 
//This class represents all that is common between Student and Mentor
//it further organize and re-use already written code
class Person {
  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
  }
  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here\`s my quirty fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}

class Student extends Person {
  // stays in Student class since it's specific to students only
  enroll(cohort) {
    this.cohort = cohort;
  }
}

class Mentor extends Person {
  // specific to mentors
  goOnShift() {
    this.onShift = true;
  }

  // specific to mentors
  goOffShift() {
    this.onShift = false;
  }
}
```
* This is a `general` Person that contains the shared code
* Person class is a `blueprint` to build a person
* Student and Mentor `inherit` behaviour and state information from Person using the keyword `extends`
* Both student and mentor have their own methods that reflects behaviour and information `only pertaining` to themselves
* Student and Mentor are `subclasses`, and Person is the `superclass`

# the Super keyword and Method Overriding
* Sometimes you want a `subclass` to have `similar` but `slightly different behaviour` to its `superclass`
* When a subclass implements a method that already ecists in the super class, it is called `method overriding`
* When the subclass then called that method, it will then run the subclass's version of the method
``` js
//taking the example from above, if in the student class that extends person, I do something like ...

class Student extends Person {
  bio () {
    console.log(`I am a coding noob and ${super.bio()}`);
  }
}
```
* This is an example of method overriding and using the super keyword to call superclass's version of the bio method
* `Overriding methods` in subclasses allow `changes in the subclasses behaviour`
* Using `super` in the overriding methods can avoid repeating code that is already in the superclass
* As for now, I think there is no way to access a superclass's property but you can access the method

# Getting and Setter
* `Getter` and `Setter` are special methods that are used to `get the value of a property` or `set the value of a property`
* Reasons for using getting and setter
  1) `Validating data` before assinging it to a property
    * We can have an object `validate` the value `before it gets set`
  2) `Computing` a value `on the fly ` instead of simply pulling it out of a property
* `Setter` allows us to `validate` data before assigning it to a property 
* `Getter` allow us to compute a value on the fly instead of simply pulling it out of a property

``` js
class Pizza {

  // ...

  // replace our custom getters / setters with these ones!
  get price() {
    const basePrice = 10;
    const toppingPrice = 2;
    return basePrice + this.toppings.length * toppingPrice;
  }

  set size(size) {
    if (size === 's' || size === 'm' || size === 'l') {
      this._size = size;
    }
  }
}

```
* `get` and `set` is `keywords` in js
* the `get` function allows you to do on the fly calcuation but still access it like a property
  * if you do pizza.get() it will give you an error saying price is not a function
  * you have to do pizza.price, so in a way the get keyword let you somewhat create a new property
* You have to use the set function like: myPizza.size = 's', any other way will throw you an error
  * but once you do that you cant do myPizza.size, it will give you an undefined
  * if you then want to acces size, you have to use a getter 
  * the setter here creates a new property _size, which you either access through myPizza._size or using a getter function

#OOP Best Practices
## Abstraction
* `Abstraction` is a technique for arranging complexity of computer system. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, supressing the more complex details below the current level

## Private vs Public
* There is no way of making things private in javascript, but if you add a `_` before it then its indicate its private and it shouldny be accessed directly

## Single Responsibility Principle
* A class should be `responsible` for a `single` part of the app's `functionality`, giving only one reason to change, having only one job
* So if you have a class called Task that has these methods:
  1) complete
  2) sendNotification
  3) saveToDataBase
* Task has 3 jobs should be broken down into just one
* Task has 3 reasons to change
  1) if we change the way we send notification (for example, from sms to email), the method has to change
  2) if we change how its persisted in the database, the method has to change 
  3) if we change how task is stored, the method has to change
* Using abstraction and single responsibility correctly will let you change one part of your app without affecting other unrelated part of your app
* 


## Mark MD Things
* Command V paste your current directory and link with the current word you are typing


## Reduce and reducer
* the reduce method use the reducer function and apply it to each element of an array, and then it returns the result of all the results combined
* reducer (accumlator, currentValue), the accumlator is the result you have gathered thus far, and in the reducer function you decide what you gonna do with the result you gathered so far with the currentValue you are looping through the array
* The return value of reducer is the accumlator 

## Midterm projects
1) Spend time planning out how each person's part is gonna work together
2) Always work on branch
3) Focus on making the main functionality of your app work first
4) Think about how what you wanna do is gonna represnet in code, sometimes things might seem easy but when you actually translate to code it can get difficult
5) Pick something that you think you can learn the most from 

## npm things
* After you clone a project, run npm install to install any dependencies
