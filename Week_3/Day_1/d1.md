# Lecture Notes

## TCP (Transport Control Protocol)
* Allows a computer to establish a long running connection with another computer
* We used the net module to establish a TCP connection with the server (connect to the snake game server)
* We also used the net module to create a TCP connection between the server and clients for File Server
* TCP is a long running connection, with connections are always started by the Client
* Connection can end by:
  - Server decision to terminate
  - Client decision to terminate
  - Network disruption 
* **Both sides can send data to each other of any kind, any time**
* Its up to you to decide whether or not if they should talk over each other (send data to each other at the same time)
* **Analogy**: allows long running internet `calls` between two machiens / devices

## HTTP Hyper-Text Transport Protocol
* Uses TCP to allow text (UTF8) based communnication between computers
* `Request-Response` based protocol
* Using older version of HTTP, client and server **Can't** talk over each other (send data to each other at the same time)
* After request and response, the client continues to request the next response
* Based on being able to fetch/submit new resources (documents)
* Rules / language of how to speak to each other (in the snake game, we use the snake protocol)
  - client speaks "Move: up"
  - server speaks with moving the snake
* 2 things make up a request 
  1) Method
  2) Path

## Express Server

# Writing Server
* When you write a server, you `have to make sure` for `paths` that you `dont want` user to `access` you change the `response status code to 404` because by `default every response status code is 200`
* What you write back to the client is the `body` of the response message
* Curl -i includes the `header` of the response message
* `404` is for an `unknown path`, the `400-series` HTTP status codes are `Client Errors`, there are also `401 and 403`
* The browsers `DevTools` (network tab) let you know if the HTTP response code is 404
