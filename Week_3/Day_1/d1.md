# Lecture Notes

## TCP (Transport Control Protocol)
* Allows a computer to establish a long running connection with another computer
* We used the net module to establish a TCP connection with the server (connect to the snake game server)
* We also used the net module to create a TCP connection between the server and clients for File Server
* TCP is a long running connection, with connections are always started by the Client
* Connection can end by:
  - Server decision to terminate
  - Client decision to terminate
  - Network disruption 
* **Both sides can send data to each other of any kind, any time**
* Its up to you to decide whether or not if they should talk over each other (send data to each other at the same time)
* **Analogy**: allows long running internet `calls` between two machiens / devices

## HTTP Hyper-Text Transport Protocol
* Uses TCP to allow text (UTF8) based communnication between computers
* `Request-Response` based protocol
* Using older version of HTTP, client and server **Can't** talk over each other (send data to each other at the same time)
* After request and response, the client continues to request the next response
* Based on being able to fetch/submit new resources (documents)
* Rules / language of how to speak to each other (in the snake game, we use the snake protocol)
  - client speaks "Move: up"
  - server speaks with moving the snake
* 2 things make up a request 
  1) Method
  2) Path

## Express Server
* `response.send` will `close` the `connection`
* `response.write` allows you to call `write multiple times`

## EJS
* `ejs` helps you `make` the `html` file into a `string` in which you can `send` `back` to the `client` as a `response`
  - Instead of putting the entire html file as a string in your JS, you could have that file somewhere else and just let ejs render it into a string and send back to the client as a response
  - You dont have to restart your server if you make change to the ejs template because the templates get loaded when it is requested by the clients
* `response.render` allows you to pass in dynamic data in the ejs template you want to render, and you do this by doing `response.render(index, {name: KV})` **(file, data)**
* In the ejs template you want to render, you get the dynamic data by `<%= dynamicData%> (Injecting data)
  - In ejs, if you want to write JS, you have to start with <% JS code %>
* `/path/:name` get you a dynamic url, in which you can access the value of `:name` by `request.params` (this is useful if you have a database of info you want to retrieve)
  - doing routing this way, `/path` is no longer a `valid path`, it has to be `/path/string` when a client is sending a request
  - and the object you get back by doing `request.params` will have the `:name` (string) as the key 
  - so if you have `/path/dragon` the object returned will be `{name: dragon}`
  - so I believe you can rename `:name` with other name you like
* `request.query` gives you an `object` `containing` all the `key value pair` after `/path?`

# Writing Server
* When you write a server, you `have to make sure` for `paths` that you `dont want` user to `access` you change the `response status code to 404` because by `default every response status code is 200`
* What you write back to the client is the `body` of the response message
* Curl -i includes the `header` of the response message
* `404` is for an `unknown path`, the `400-series` HTTP status codes are `Client Errors`, there are also `401 and 403`
* The browsers `DevTools` (network tab) let you know if the HTTP response code is 404
* You also have to make sure you `end the request` from the client 
* **For a given request, only one of the callback handler is called**
* In path, anything after `/path?` contains many `key value pair` that we can access
  - In Express Server, you can access the `key value pair` by doing `request.query`
  - Used more for `tracking` reason (optional information)
* `Routing` refers to how an applications `endpoints`(URL) `responds` to client `response`
* We can test our web server using both our `browser` and `curl`

# Template
* Templates are `files` that `define` the `presentation` of a web app's `data` `separately` from the `server` logic
* They keep server logic seperate from mark up, making it easier to modify or debug 
* The template engine `replaces` `variables` in a template `file` with actual `data`
* Then `transforms` the template into HTML and `send` it to the `client` **(which is the browser)**

## EJS Notes
* we use Express render method to respond to request by sending back a template, along with an object containing the data the template needs
* We then use EJS to render this data to our web page

### Basics

``` js
//set the view engine to ejs by doing
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// use res.render to load up an ejs view file
//render will look in a views folder, so you gonna have to create a view folder
//but then afterwards you can just put in the path because it automatically fills in the view/ part for you

// index page 
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.render('pages/index');
});
```

### Using EJS Partials
* The synatx to use an EJS parital is <% include FILENAME %>
* Using EJS partials, we can further breakdown a HTML file
* EJS is basically HTML, but you can add some JS code in it to make it more dynamic (for example injecting data or writing a for loop like in lectures)
* partial file have a `_` infront of their filename, signifying that its a partial

### Injecting Data / Variables
* The synatx to inject data is <%= VariableName %>
* You also have to pass an object into render:
* When sending variables to EJS template. we need to send them inside an object, even if we are only sending one variable
* This is so we can use the key of that vairable to access the data within our template
#### Exmaple1
```js
//for example, say we had the following route hanlder:
app.get("/hello", (req, res) => {
  let templateVars = { greeting: 'Hello World!' };
  res.render("hello_world", templateVars);
});
```
* In the example above, the `templateVars` object `contains` the `string` 'Hello World' under the `key` `greeting`. We then pass the `templateVars` object to the template called `hello_world`.

``` html
<!-- This would display the string "Hello World!" -->
<h1><%= greeting %></h1>
```
* <%= %> the reuslt of this will show up on the page
* <% %> this wouldnt

```html
<!-- This line will not show up on the page -->
<% if(greeting) {%>
  <!-- This line will only show if greeting is truthy -->
  <h1><%= greeting %></h1>
<% }%>
```

#### Example 2
``` js
const drinks = [
    { name: 'Bloody Mary', drunkness: 3 },
    { name: 'Martini', drunkness: 5 },
    { name: 'Scotch', drunkness: 10 }
  ];
const tagline = "Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else.";

res.render('pages/index', {
    drinks: drinks,
    tagline: tagline
})
```
* The `key` name is what you are going to pass as VariableName in EJS

### Looping Over Data
* put the beginning of the for loop in <% %>
* then put your inside for loop statements and data in <%=%>
* put the end of the for loop in <%%>

### Route Parameters
* route parameters will be in the format of /path/:id
* the `:` infront of the id indicates that it is a route parameter 
* which means that the `value` in this part of the url will be `available` in the `req.params object`
* with the key being id, so if you do `req.params.id` you will get the value
* For example, `/urls/b2xVn2` with the foramt of `/urls/:shortURL` will result in {shortURL: b2xVn2} if you do `req.params`


# CRUD and HTTP
* Almost all web app allows users to manipulate data in these four categories
  
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Create | Add a new record|
| Read | Retrieve the value of a record
| Update | Update a record's value
| Delete | Delete a record

* In the case of web app, HTTP is the protocol used to facilitate communication between the interface and the database

* To `take` an `action` on a `resource`, a `client` (ex browser) `sends` an `HTTP` `request` to a server `with` the appropriate `URL` and `method`

| HTTP Method | CRUD Action |
|--------|-------------|
| Get | Read |  
| Post | Create |  
| Put | Update |
| Delete| Delete |

## Safe methods
* Methods such as `Get` , `Head`, `Options`, `Trace` are defined as `safe`, meaning they are **intended only for info retrieval and should not change the state of the server**

* Methods such as `Post`, `Put`, `Delete`, `Patch` are **intended for actions that may cause side effects either on the server, or external side effects such as financial transaction or transmission of email**

## Idempotent methods
* `Idempotent` means` multiple identical request` should `have` the `same effect as a single request`
* `Idempotence` refers to the `state of the system after the request has completed`
* Methods `Put` and `Delete` are deinfed to be `idemopotent`
* Methods `Get`, being prescribed as `safe`, should also be `idempotent`
* Methods `Post`, is not necessarily idempotent. **Sending an identical Post request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects**
* It is up to the web app to handle cases where a Post request should not be submitted more than once
* To update a resource in an `idempotent` way, we should use `put` (beacuase many update should have the same effect as one update, assuming they are of the same value)
* To update a resource in a `non-idempotent` way, we should use `post`



# Tech In Notes
* Always explain your thought process, even if its for little things
* Always ask questions if you are unsure, even if its just params 
* Always tell the interviewer what you are doing or thinking, even if its just writing out comments or pusdecode
* Always be communative
* Ask them question such as if you will be mentored
