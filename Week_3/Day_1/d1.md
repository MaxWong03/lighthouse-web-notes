# Writing Server
* When you write a server, you `have to make sure` for `paths` that you `dont want` user to `access` you change the `response status code to 404` because by `default every response status code is 200`
* What you write back to the client is the `body` of the response message
* Curl -i includes the `header` of the response message
* `404` is for an `unknown path`, the `400-series` HTTP status codes are `Client Errors`, there are also `401 and 403`
* The browsers `DevTools` (network tab) let you know if the HTTP response code is 404
