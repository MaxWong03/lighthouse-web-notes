# Lecture Notes



# Routing
* A `Get` and `Post` request is basically making a request through a `URL`
* In which the `server` has to `route` these `URL`
* `Routing` is the `server's` way of `handling request`
* You could have a `different route for` a `different request` 
* for example, a `Post` request could make a request through the `URL` url/:shortURL/delete
* then your server route that url and handle the post request
* Another example would be a Post request that make a request through the URL url/:shortURL/edit, then your server route that url and handle the post request
* So in a way, you could `pre-determined your routes` thats gonna be `handled` by your `server` when `writing the post request` that is gonna be `made by your client` when `designing a web app`
* when your server is `routing` a `URL` from a `request`, its like saying `how is the server going to handle such request to that url`
* Everytime you `type` a `url` to the `address` `bar` or `go to a url`, that is a `Get` `request`
* That is true for a html hyperlink tag `<a href>` upon clicking, because the hyperlink will be put on the address bar
* So your server has to handle that route
* Sometimes you might have the different request for the same route, those need to be handled differently because they are triggered differently

# HTML things
## input type = "submit"
* The input type="submit" defines a `submit button` which `submits` all form `values` to a `form-handler`
* `input elements` of type `submit` are `rendered` as `buttons`
* You could override the form's attribute, but otherwise it will take form's `method` and `action` when it is `clicked`
* if there is `no form`, then the `default` `body` in a `post` request is `undefined`

# Javascript things
* `delete` operator `removes` a `property` from an `object`
``` js
var Employee = {
  firstname: "John",
  lastname: "Doe"
}
delete Employee.firstname;
//this will remove first name from Employee
```

# CLI Things
* You use curl -X to make a Post request
