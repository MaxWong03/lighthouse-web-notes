# Lecture Notes

### Routes
* 2 parts make up a route 
  1) Path 
  2) Method
* Same path but different method = different route

### REST Representational State Transfer
* Routes represent the underlying structure of the data


### HTML input and label 
* the `label` `tag` associate the `input tag` by specifying the `attriabute` in `for`
* so the for `attribute value in form tag` has to `match` the `id attribute value` in the `input tag`
* input tag also has an important attribute called `name`, in which you `define` a variable `key` that will be `sent` with the `request` `inside body`
* `form` is usually `combined` with some kind of `input with type = submit` (button type=submit is an example)
* `form` can be `submitted` with the key `enter`
* if you wanna `capture` `info / data from user`, you will` use form `
* 

### Express server
* you need to install `body-parser` to do `req.body`
* `morgan` is a `logger` that delivers `feedback` (use when you create an api)
* morgan overwrites console.log tho, so if you want some specific value you need to disable it 
* If you make a `Get` request, `render`
* If you make a `Post` request, `redirect` and `get`
* The `redirection` `makes` the `client` to submit another `Get` request
* The server redirects the client, and the client then makes another get request (which is forced by the reidrect)
* if you have a can not get, that means you havent declared the route yet
* there is a npm package called `uuid` that allows you to generate a unique alpha numeric string

# Git Branches
* A `remote repo` holds the `master` version of each of the `files` of our `project`
* Working in `branches` allow you to `work` on the `code` and `push` it to `GitHub` without `effecting` the `master` branch
* `Branching` means you `diverge` from the `main line` of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line
* git branch shows all the branch and which branch you on


## Branches in a Nutshell
* Git `stores` data as a `series of snapshots`
* Git `stores` a `commit object` that contains a `pointer to the snapshot` of the content you `staged`, and `pointers` to the `commit or commits` that directly came `before this commit` (its parents or parents)
* When you do `git commit`, Git creates `3 objects`
  1) # of `blobs` each representing the contents of the files
  2) One `tree` that `lists` the content of the `directory` and `specifies` which `file names are stored as which blobs`
  3) One `commit` with the `pointer` to that `root tree` and all `commit metadata`
* When you make some changes and commit again, the `next commit` stores a `pointer` to the `commit` that came `immediately` before it (the tree is the snapshot)
* So you have a new commit object that points to its own tree which points to its own blobs of the current commit, but also to the previous commits object
* A `branch` is a `movable pointer` to one of these `commits`

## Creating a New Branch
* `Creating` a new `branch` creates a `new pointer` for you to `move around`
* The `HEAD pointer` poinits to the `local branch` you are currently on (default is master)
* When you first create a branch, you are still on master, because `git branch` command only creates a new branch, it doesnt switch to the branch
* `git log` shows you `where` the branch pointers are `pointing` (--online --decorate)

## Switching Branches
* To switch to an `existing branch`, you do `git checkout`
* This `moves` **Head** to point to another branch
* The `HEAD` branch `moves forward` when a `commit is made`
* So if you were to `git checkout` master again, the HEAD pointer move back to point to the master branch, and **it reverted the files in your working directory back to the** `snapshot` that master point to
* Its typical to create a new branch and want to switch to that new branch at the same time, this can be acheived by `git checkout -b newbranchname`

## Divergent history
* `git log --online --decorate --graph --all` prints out the `history` of your `commits`, showing `where` your branch `pointers` are and how your `history` has `diverged`

## Merging
* Merging in Git creates a special commit that has two unqiue parents
* A commit with two parents means I want to include all the work from this parent over here and this one over here, and the set of all their parents
* Merge is always from the directory you want to merge other directory from
  - for example, you work on a new branch and now you are ready to get those features
  - you go to master, and merge the new branch

# Cookies

## Background
* `Communication` between the `browser` and our `app` is done over `HTTP`
* HTTP is `stateless`, each `request` is treated `independently` and request can `happen` in `any order` (as opposed to TCP, in which everything happens in an order)
* `Cookies` is a `feature` of `HTTP` that `distinguish` each users `HTTP` `request`, and using cookies we can `treat` each `user` `independently`
* Using `Set-Cookie header` in an HTTP `response`, a HTTP `server` can tell a `client` to `rememeber` certain `key` and `values` (cookies)
* In all `subsequent` HTTP `request` **from the client to the server**, these keys and values are `included` `in` the Cookie `header`. In a way, the server is asking a `client` to keep `reminding` the `server` of the client's `idenity` and other `info` with every `subsequent` `request`

## Cookie Basics
* What is saved to a cookie is up to the creator of the website to decide 
* A unqiue ID is stored in a cookie on your computer, the rest of the data is stored in the web server (cookie serve as an identifier of your computer)
* Third Parties Cookies: A website embedded in another website can use cookies and save info about you, without having you directly accessing that website
* Cookies are stored at the browser level (you will need separate cookies for each browser)
* You will have multiple cookies for multiple websites
* `Tracking pixels` allow a page load on one site to communicate data to servers from a third party (the third party then has your info stored as a cookie. Subsequent visit to the third party website will retrieve your info with the cookie)
* Server can respond back with a `Set-Cookie` response `header` which `ask` the `client` to `set and store` the cookie 

## Tiny App Login Example (before password)
1) Client type in the user name
2) Server set that value with a cookie named "username"
3) with the redirect, the server sends a response with cookie to the client 
4) and now every http request made by the client has its cookie with it 

## Cookie Accessibility
* A browser cookie is `specific` to the `domain` that created it
* Only webpages `within the domain` that created the cookie are `able` to `access its content`
* Only cookies that `pertain` to the `website` in question are `included` in the `request header`

# Routing
* A `Get` and `Post` request is basically making a request through a `URL`
* In which the `server` has to `route` these `URL`
* `Routing` is the `server's` way of `handling request`
* You could have a `different route for` a `different request` 
* for example, a `Post` request could make a request through the `URL` url/:shortURL/delete
* then your server route that url and handle the post request
* Another example would be a Post request that make a request through the URL url/:shortURL/edit, then your server route that url and handle the post request
* So in a way, you could `pre-determined your routes` thats gonna be `handled` by your `server` when `writing the post request` that is gonna be `made by your client` when `designing a web app`
* when your server is `routing` a `URL` from a `request`, its like saying `how is the server going to handle such request to that url`
* Everytime you `type` a `url` to the `address` `bar` or `go to a url`, that is a `Get` `request`
* That is true for a html hyperlink tag `<a href>` upon clicking, because the hyperlink will be put on the address bar
* So your server has to handle that route
* Sometimes you might have the different request for the same route, those need to be handled differently because they are triggered differently

# HTML things
## input type = "submit"
* The input type="submit" defines a `submit button` which `submits` all form `values` to a `form-handler`
* `input elements` of type `submit` are `rendered` as `buttons`
* You could override the form's attribute, but otherwise it will take form's `method` and `action` when it is `clicked`
* if there is `no form`, then the `default` `body` in a `post` request is `undefined`

---

# Javascript things
* `delete` operator `removes` a `property` from an `object`
``` js
var Employee = {
  firstname: "John",
  lastname: "Doe"
}
delete Employee.firstname;
//this will remove first name from Employee
```

---

# CLI Things
* You use curl -X to make a Post request
* -d flag with curl send data in the say way a broswer would
