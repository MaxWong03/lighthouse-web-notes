# Authentication and Security

## Stragery to Storing Password Securly 
* Hasing
  * One way encrpytion that can not be reversed
  1) When you log in, the server hash your password, and compare it to the hashed password it stores in its database (during register)
  2) It then compare the two hash and see if they match
* Encrpytion
  * Taking a piece of info, translating(encoding) it, and having the receiving party interpert it (decoding)


## Session Storage
* store only info only during visit (page visited), and gone after you close the tab
* store on your browser, expires on tab close
* doesnt sent with request

## Local Storage
* store on your browser, never expires
* Example: form data
* good for the case of disconnection / unexpected browser termination, website can reopen the browser and use the form data stored
* doesnt sent with request



## JS Things
* `array.find(cb)` returns the value of the `FIRST (ONE) element` that cb(el) return true
* `array.filter(cb)` returns the value of `ALL element` that cb(el) return true
* Use `node --inspect` to debug server
* 

## Server Things
* [Check out `Middleware`](https://github.com/fzero/lhl-lectures/blob/master/w2d4-user-auth/code-nobcrypt/server.js#L44)
* you have to make sure you check some stuff like edit and delet with curl because you could access those endpoint with out the front 
* you dont need to pass in cookies if you redirect

### Sessions
* `Session Cookies` - cookies that `expire after a browser is closed`
* `User Session` - login/lout feature on a site, the event of a user using an application
* `Session` 
  1) encrpyted cookiesw
  2) abstraction that refers to user data, can be tracked by
    * `storing` data in an `encrpyted cookie`
    * `storing` an `id` in an `encrpyted cookie` with `session store` on the `server side`

#Debugging
* Sometimes when things doesnt make sense, it might be because the error is at somewhere else
* Expect css or html error can occur, bug might not have anything to do with logic
* When you write rotes, remember you have to put '/' before 'url' ('/' matters a lot in routing)

# Code

## WELL STRUCTURED AND THOUGHTOUT CODE EXAMPLE
``` js 
const testUsers = {
  "userRandomID": {
    id: "userRandomID", 
    email: "user@example.com", 
    password: "purple-monkey-dinosaur"
  },
  "user2RandomID": {
    id: "user2RandomID", 
    email: "user2@example.com", 
    password: "dishwasher-funk"
  }
};

describe('getUserByEmail', ()  => {
  it('should return a user with valid email', () => {

    const user = getUserByEmail(testUsers, "user@example.com");
    const expectedOutput = "userRandomID";
    assert.strictEqual(user.id, expectedOutput);
  });
  it('should return false when passed invalid email', () => {
    const user = getUserByEmail(testUsers, "user@examwple.com");
    const expectedOutput = false;
    assert.strictEqual(user, expectedOutput);
  });
  it('should return the user object that matches with the valid email', () => {
    const user = getUserByEmail(testUsers, "user2@example.com");
    const expectedOutput = testUsers.user2RandomID;
    assert.deepEqual(user, expectedOutput);
  });
});
```
