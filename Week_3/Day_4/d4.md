# Lecture
* use `Postman` to check your end points

## Middleware
* Anything that happens `between` a `request` and `response`
* `Middleware` happens between the `request` and `response` `pipeline`
* Middleware is a `function` in which you can `passed` to the `express` `pipeline` (`using app.use`)
* In which you `high jack the pipeline` and `do` what you want with your `MiddleWare`
* But you have to `make sure `you give a response back
* When you have `multiple Middleware`, you need to think about how you gonna `pass control over (call)` the `next` Middleware
* Middleware should `take in the request and response` because it` happens in the middle of the pipeline` (you hijacked it)
* Think about `what kind of request you can make to connect to the end points`
* `Every` `Middleware` gets `run` by `every request by default`
* If you want a Middleware to run only during a certain request, then write a if statemnet inside your Middleware
* If you want to specify a endpoint (like in the example), it includes all request, so you need extra logic inside your middleware to check the condition
* and the `endpoint` has to be `specific` or you gonna catch everything
* Maybe: that two routes that share the same name but with different methods can be handled by one MiddleWare and if else statement inside ??
* Use closure when you make your middleware function, your middleware function has to return the real middleware funciton 
**Check out exisitng middleware to see how they are implemented**

``` js
app.use('/url', (req,res, next) => {
  //do your own thing here....
  next() //call back that calls the next Middleware
});
```

## Routes
* checkout `express.route`
* once you have the routes in your file you can do `app.use(route)`

# REST
* Convention and practices that deals with `accessing` and `manipulating` resources over HTTP

## Resource Identifier
* Name is typically the name of the `object type`, `lower case`, separated with `hyphens`
* For `members` of the `collection`, a `unique identifier` should be indicated
  * done by adding a member object's `id` after a `slash` following the `collection identifier`
  * `/users` is user collection, first user would be `/users/1`




# package.json things
* add a `^` infront of the version and do `npm i` will install the newest version of the package
