# Lecture
* use `Postman` to check your end points

## Middleware
* Anything that happens `between` a `request` and `response`
* `Middleware` happens between the `request` and `response` `pipeline`
* Middleware is a `function` in which you can `passed` to the `express` `pipeline` (`using app.use`)
* In which you `high jack the pipeline` and `do` what you want with your `MiddleWare`
* But you have to `make sure `you give a response back
* When you have `multiple Middleware`, you need to think about how you gonna `pass control over (call)` the `next` Middleware
* Middleware should `take in the request and response` because it` happens in the middle of the pipeline` (you hijacked it)
* Think about `what kind of request you can make to connect to the end points`
* `Every` `Middleware` gets `run` by `every request by default`
* If you want a Middleware to run only during a certain request, then write a if statemnet inside your Middleware
* If you want to specify a endpoint (like in the example), it includes all request, so you need extra logic inside your middleware to check the condition
* and the endpoint has to be speicfic or you gonna catch everything

``` js
app.use('/url', (req,res, next) => {
  //do your own thing here....
  next() //call back that calls the next Middleware
});
```
