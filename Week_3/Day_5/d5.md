# Data Structures
* Programming reloves around `data` and we write `software` to `retrieve`, `modify`, and `display` data
* `Array`
  - **Pros:** when we have a `list` of data especially when that list is `in some order`
* `Objects`
- **Pros:** when we want to be able to look up data quickly using a key

# Tree 
* Compsoed of `individual` key entities and their `relationships` with `other` key entities
* The `relationships` **between different key entities** `sets` tree apart

# Tree Structure
* Each `key entity` is a tree is called `node`
* A `node` represents a `key entity` and **`contains data`** `about that entity`
* All the `connections` **between** the `nodes` are called `edges`
* `Trees` are a great `data` `structure` to use when your `data` has `hierarchical relationships`
* Trees `allows` us to `use` these `relationships` in code making the `data easier to process`

**We can build a tree out of anything as long as the nodes have a single parent and many childern:**

**Node** |
---
parent |
childern |
data |

**In our example, our structure is **

**Node** | **Employee**
---------|-------------
parent | boss
childern | subordinates
data | name, title, slary

**Other Examples**
1) The Browser's Dom

**Node** | **HTMLElement**
---------|-------------
parent | Parent Element
childern | Child Element
data | Attributes (id, class, etc)



## Example
![Tree Example](SampleTree.png)

* In this example:
  1) Each `node` represents an `employee`
  2) And the `data` contains their `name`

## Back to Tree Structure
* The node at the very `top` of the tree is called `root node`
* The nodes on the very `bottom` are called `leaf nodes`
* Every node (**except for the root**) has a `single parent node`
* Every node that `isnt leaf` node has `1 or more childern nodes`
* `Childern` with the `same parent` are `sibilings`



### JS Things

### Rest Parmaeters
* when you write a function, if you put (...args) as the params, then you gonna turn the input data into an array
* Rest Params have to be at the last argument because it collects all `remaining`arguments into an array

### Spread Operator
* Use when adding array elements into an exisitng array
* Or copying array
* So its more used when you pass it into an function?
``` js
const arr = ["Joy", "Wangari", "Warugu"];
const newArr = ["joykare", ...arr];
const arr = [1,2,3];
const arr2 = [...arr]
```

### Object.entries()
``` js
const obj = { foo: 'bar', baz: 42 };
console.log(Object.entries(obj)); // [ ['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 42] ]
```

### Array.push
* Array.push accepts multiple arguments and can push all the arguments in at once
