# CSS Notes

## Box Model
* `Padding` is the `space` between the `content` and the `border`

## Block vs Inline
* `Block` takes up the entire line, it can't coexist with other element
* `Inline` can coexist with other inline element

## Nesting
* Dont put block element inside inline elements

## Position
1) Static
   - Default, cant set TRBL
2) Relative
   - TRBL can be set relative to where it would have been statically positioned
   - It still takes up space in where it would have been statically positioned
3) Absoulte
   - TRBL can be set to the nearest postioned ancestor
   - its positioned ancestor have to have a the position relative
   - it exists on its own plane, doesnt take up any space
   - if you put something as absoulte position but not specifying any box offset , your element will be positioned in the top left of its closest relatively positioned parent
4) Fixed
   - TRBL is set relative to the browser viewport and it stays in the same position even when the content is scrolled
5) Sticky
   - Check out sticky, its good for menu and responsive design

## Box Offset Properties
* For `relatively` positioned elements, these properties `specify` `how` an `element` should be `moved` form its `default position`
* For `absolute` or `fixed` positioning, these properties `specify` the `distance` `between` the `element` and the `edges` of its `parents` element
* `top` properties will take priority over `bottom`
* In English pages, the `left` offset property is given priority

## Z-Index
* `z-index` is used to change the order of how elements are stacked
* Generally, elements coming at the top of the DOM are positioned behind elements coming after them
* Element with the highest z-index value will appear on the top regardless of its placement in the DOM
* **You need position value of relative, absolute, or fixed to apply the z-index property**

## Selectors
``` CSS
div, .primary{
  this will style all div tag and tags with class primary
}

div.primary{
  this will style all tags that is of div and have class primary
}

div .primary{
  this will style all descendant of div that is of class primary
}

/* or using the fact that it has an attribute! */
[attr] { font-size:smaller; }

/* or that the attribute has a specific value */
[attr='value'] { font-size:smaller; }

/* starts with a value (CSS 3) */
[attr^='val'] { font-size:smaller; }

/* or ends with a value (CSS 3) */
[attr$='ue'] { font-size:smaller; }

.parent * { } /* all descendants */
.parent > * { } /* all children */

```

## Media query
``` CSS
/* make the font bigger when shown on a screen at least 480px wide */
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 3em;
    font-weight: normal;
  }
}
```

## Selectors Example
``` html
<div class="root">
  <div class="direct descendant" id="a"></div>
  <div class="adjacent sibiling to a" id="b">
    <div class="descendant to root">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="general sibiling to a and b"></div>
</div>

```

## ID and Classes
* `class` should imply `stylistic` or `behavioral` properties about an element 
* Uses `classes` `most of the time`, and use `ID sparingly`
* Use `ID` when you have a `unique` element that is `styled` or `behaved` very `differently` than other elements
* Use neither unless necessary, **you can always target any element without giving it a class or ID**

### ID Special Browser Functionality
* If you have a URL `http://yourdomain.com#comments` and an element with an ID `comments`, the browser will locate the element with ID `comments` and automatically scroll the page to show that element
