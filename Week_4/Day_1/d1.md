# CSS Notes

## Box Model
* `Padding` is the `space` between the `content` and the `border`

## Block vs Inline
* `Block` takes up the entire line, it can't coexist with other element
* `Inline` can coexist with other inline element

## Nesting
* Dont put block element inside inline elements

## Position
1) Static
   - Default, cant set TRBL
2) Relative
   - TRBL can be set relative to where it would have been statically positioned
   - It still takes up space in where it would have been statically positioned
3) Absoulte
   - TRBL can be set to the nearest postioned ancestor
   - its positioned ancestor have to have a the position relative
   - it exists on its own plane, doesnt take up any space
4) Fixed
   - TRBL is set relative to the viewport and it stays in the same position even when the content is scrolled
5) Sticky
   - Check out sticky, its good for menu and responsive design


## ID and Classes
* `class` should imply `stylistic` or `behavioral` properties about an element 
* Uses `classes` `most of the time`, and use `ID sparingly`
* Use `ID` when you have a `unique` element that is `styled` or `behaved` very `differently` than other elements
* Use neither unless necessary, **you can always target any element without giving it a class or ID**

### ID Special Browser Functionality
* If you have a URL `http://yourdomain.com#comments` and an element with an ID `comments`, the browser will locate the element with ID `comments` and automatically scroll the page to show that element
