## Ajax
* Ajax can be used to do things like analytics, because it does things behind the scenes that the user cant notice

## Ajax Flow
1) Client side JS make a AJAX call (UI isnt disturbed)
2) AJAX make a HTTP request to server side JS(up to developer if they wanna show loading icon)
3) HTTP request fetch data from Database (to server side JS)
4) AJAX gets data from server side JS, pass the data back to client side JS using callback
5) Client side JS can then use the data to update dom if desired




# AJAX
* `HTTP response` is `passed` to a `JavaScript` function, and that `function` is `responsible` for determining what to do with it
* Ajax is used to get `data` from web server into `Strings` in JS. 
* The '/' route is equivalent to 'WhateverPathYouAreAt/'

## Experiment with HTTP server and Static files
1) install `http-server`
2) then run `http-server` in command line
3) This will tell your `web server` to run on localhost:8080 and `serve static` (html, js, css, image, etc) `files` in the `current directory`

## HTML Tags
* hr creates a line 

## Other things
* you can do `document.cookie` to get the cookies of the webpage
* dont assume user data is always clean
* submit event can be triggered sometimes just by hitting enter, so its important to choose the right event handler
