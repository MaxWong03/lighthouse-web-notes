# AJAX
* `HTTP response` is `passed` to a `JavaScript` function, and that `function` is `responsible` for determining what to do with it
* Ajax is used to get `data` from web server into `Strings` in JS. 



## Experiment with HTTP server and Static files
1) install `http-server`
2) then run `http-server` in command line
3) This will tell your `web server` to run on localhost:8080 and `serve static` (html, js, css, image, etc) `files` in the `current directory`
