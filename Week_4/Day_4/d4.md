[Responsive Notes](https://github.com/garrettgsb/responsive-design-and-sass)
* CSS - overriding browser default
* There is browser default for HTML elemenets
* Element negoiates for spaces  
* Think about how the box behaves on different viewport (abstracting content inside the box away from the design)
* Responsive Design Accomodates
  1) Content changes
  2) Viewport changes
* `Above the Fold` - stuff that you see `before you scroll`, that should attracts users to start using the website
* `Navigation` is important because it is a `call to action`, because when the landing attracts user enough they can go ahead and findout more about the product
* `Position` , `Size` indicates how important something is

## Responsive design tricks
* nav bar `changes` based on `margin`
* `keep clarity `across different viewport
* `maintain information hierachy` consistent on different viewport
  1) `margin` (white space)
  2) `showing and hiding` elements
  3) `reflowing` layout
  4) `resizing` content
* `chew` away `margin` **until breakpoint**

## Adapative Design
* **In HTTP request, your UA (user agent) is sent with the request to let the server know the type of device you are operating in**
  - the server has to render different content based on the type of device

## Flow Layout
* Default behaviour for HTML

## Flexbox
[Typical use of Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Typical_Use_Cases_of_Flexbox)
* `justify-content` operates work on `X axis`
* `align-items` operates on `Y axis`
* `flex-start` takes as much spaces as it needs

## Useful CSS Properties
* `word-wrap`
* `overflow-y`
* `flex-grow`
* `flex-shrink`
* `clear` (does not allow floating element)

## CSS unit
* `vmin` - the smallest between vh and vw

# Responsive Design

## Media Queries
* CSS that `depends` on `screen size` and `media type`
* An `expression` thats `evaluated` to be true or false, if its `true` then the `style` thats `associated` with it its going to be `applied`
* `media-type` and `(media-feature)`
* `breakpoint` is the `point` where you `want` your new `style` to `apply`
* choose your breakpoint by resizing the window until it feels uncomfortable
* The style `outside` of the media queries its your `default` 
* `mobile should be the default` becaues of their slower connection and limited data

## Media Queries Example 
* rules inside media queries have more specificty
* `max-width`: `maximally (at most)`  of a certain width
* `min-width`: `minimually (at least)` of a certain width
``` css
@media all and (max-width: 600px)
```
* targeting all media types when vewiport has a width of 600px

``` css
@media (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 600px) 
```
* setting upper and lower bound
``` css
@media print {
  nav, .ad{
    display:none;
  }
  a{
    text-decoration: none;
    color: inherit
  }
}
```
* when user prints, hide the nav bar and ads, as well as remove hyperlink decoration and inherit the color from its parent
``` css
@media not screen
```
* every media type except for screen, not has to be used with a media type

## Chaining Media Query
``` css
@media not screen, screen and (max-width: 400px)
```
* Looking for anything that is not a screen, or anything that is a screen with the max-width of 400px

## Overlapping Media Query
``` css
@media (min-width:300px);
@media (min-width:600px);
@media (min-width:900px);
```
* because there is no upper bound, 600 will collects style in 300, and 900 will collects style in 600 and 300 (cumulative effect)
* you might have to override style if the lower bound media query contains a style that you dont want
* the order of these overlapping media query matters
* Unless you have radically different style or different breakpoint, overlapping is usually easier

## Mutually Exclusive Media Query
``` css
@media (min-width:300px) and (max-width: 599px);
@media (min-width:600px) and (max-width: 899px);
@media (min-width:900px);
```
* becareful not to overlap in mutually exclusive media query because you will then apply 2 or more media queries 
* mutually exclusive style is good for background image for different breakpoint (because webkit download all images even if they are overridden)

# Viewport Unit
* viewport is the area where the browser render the site
* `vw`: 1/100th viewport width
* `vh`: 1/100th viewport height
* `vmin`: 1/100th of the smallest side
* `vmax`: 1/100th of the largest side
* “When the value of ‘overflow’ on the root element is ‘auto’, any scroll bars are assumed not to exist.”
* That means 100vw is the width of the viewport, scroll bar included. In OS X, everything will look fine. On Windows however, the two grid items together are wider than the viewport, scroll bar excluded, thus will be unable to render the two blocks next to each other.

# REM vs EM vs PX
* `Pixel` is absoulte regardless of everything else
* `Em` is relative to the `font-size` of its `parent`
  - use an sboulte px measure, and then scale/resize everything else with em
* `Rem` relative to the font-size of the `html` element 

# Notes on design
* `Fluid` layout `stretches` and `shrinks` to `fill` the `width` of the `screen`
* `Fixed-width` layout is of the `same width` regarldess of the screen dimenison
* Almost all responsive design have the pattern of `fluid` in `moblie and tablet` and `fixed-width` in `desktop`
* Ideally you want to choose your `breakpoints` around your `content and design`


# SASS
[SASS Guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
**Nesting Example**
``` css
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```
**replaces**
``` css
nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}
nav a {
  display: block;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

# Mixins
``` css
  @mixin transform($property) {
  -webkit-transform: $property;
  -ms-transform: $property;
  transform: $property;
}
.box { @include transform(rotate(30deg)); }
```

# Extend/Inheritance
``` css
%message-shared {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}
.warning {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: yellow;
}
```

# Learning CSS
* Best way to learn css is to go in chrome, and find an elemenet, and go to its parent and set some property and see what that does
