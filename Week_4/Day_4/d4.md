# Lecture
* CSS - overriding browser default
* There is browser default for HTML elemenets 
* Think about how the box behaves on different viewport (abstracting content inside the box away from the design)
* Responsive Design Accomodates
  1) Content changes
  2) Viewport changes
* `Above the Fold` - stuff that you see `before you scroll`, that should attracts users to start using the website
* `Navigation` is important because it is a `call to action`, because when the landing attracts user enough they can go ahead and findout more about the product
* `Position` , `Size` indicates how important something is

## Responsive design tricks
* nav bar `changes` based on `margin`
* `keep clarity `across different viewport
* `maintain information hierachy` consistent on different viewport
* `chew` away `margin` **until breakpoint**
* 

## Useful CSS Properties
* `word-wrap`
* `overflow-y`

# Responsive Design

## Media Queries
* CSS that `depends` on `screen size` and `media type`
* An `expression` thats `evaluated` to be true or false, if its `true` then the `style` thats `associated` with it its going to be `applied`
* `media-type` and `(media-feature)`
* `breakpoint` is the `point` where you `want` your new `style` to `apply`
* choose your breakpoint by resizing the window until it feels uncomfortable

## Media Queries Example 
``` css
@media all and (max-width: 600px)
```
* targeting all media types when vewiport has a width of 600px

``` css
@media (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 600px) 
```
* setting upper and lower bound
``` css
@media print {
  nav, .ad{
    display:none;
  }
  a{
    text-decoration: none;
    color: inherit
  }
}
```
* when user prints, hide the nav bar and ads, as well as remove hyperlink decoration and inherit the color from its parent
``` css
@media not screen
```
* every media type except for screen, not has to be used with a media type

## Chaining Media Query
``` css
@media not screen, screen and (max-width: 400px)
```
* Looking for anything that is not a screen, or anything that is a screen with the max-width of 400px

## Overlapping Media Query
``` css
@media (min-width:300px);
@media (min-width:600px);
@media (min-width:900px);
```
* because there is no upper bound, 600 will collects style in 300, and 900 will collects style in 600 and 300 (cumulative effect)
* you might have to override style if the lower bound media query contains a style that you dont want
* the order of these overlapping media query matters
* Unless you have radically different style or different breakpoint, overlapping is usually easier

## Mutually Exclusive Media Query
``` css
@media (min-width:300px) and (max-width: 599px);
@media (min-width:600px) and (max-width: 899px);
@media (min-width:900px);
```
* becareful not to overlap in mutually exclusive media query because you will then apply 2 or more media queries 
* mutually exclusive style is good for background image for different breakpoint (because webkit download all images even if they are overridden)
