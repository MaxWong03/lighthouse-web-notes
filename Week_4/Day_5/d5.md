# Algorithms
* Algorithms' speed are measured by counting the number of `elementary operations`
* `Elementary operations` takes constant amount of time to perform
* If an algorithm performs `n elementary operations`, we say the `running time is n`
* **1+2 will take the same amount of time as 1234+5678**

## Example of Elementary Operation
``` js 
number1 + number2; // no matter what number 1 and number 2 is, it will take the same amount of time to add 2 numbers together

console.log(somestring) //no matter what somestring is, it will take the same amount of time to console.log o
```

## Binary Search

### What is Binary Search
* Binary Search is a `halving approach` to `searching` an `item` in a set of `ordered data`
* Repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you narrowed down the possible location to just one
* The main idea of binary search is to` keep track of the current range of reasonable guesses`
* Binary search `halves` the `size` of the reasonable portion `upon every incorrect guess`
* Once the reasonable portion contains just one element, the result is either correct or incorrect.
* Depending on how you written your binary search, you might or might not get to finish when the array is at 2, so you might need one more step to have the reasonable portion to just contain one elemenet
* thats why run time is log(n) + 1 

### When and Why Binary Search
* when we need to `search` for something in a set of `ordered data`
* Finding an item in an array


### Run Time Example 
```
300 > 150 > 75 > 37.5 > 18.75 > 9.4 > 4.5 > 2.25 > 1
2^0   2^1   2^2   2^3    2^4    2^5   2^6    2^7   2^8
log_2(8) = 8.23 , no more than 9 times
```

**Example**
``` js
const primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97];
/**
 * suppose we want to know if 67 is prime ...
 * if 67 is in the array primes, then it is a prime number
 * we might also want to know how many primes are smaller than 67 (we can find out because the prime array is sorted, and binary search works on ordered data)
 * array indices indicate how many items COME BEFORE it 
 */
```

### Implementing Algorithm
* when you implement binary search on an array, it might be the **value** that is stored in the indices that you are looking for
* Therefore, you need to think about what each return indices mean....
* if max is less than min, that means we search through the entire array and cant find it
* and we return -1 because -1 is an invalud array indices

> People might intuitively know how to fill in the missing details, but computer programs do not. That's why we need to describe computer algorithms completely.

**Check List**

* What are the `inputs` ? 
* What are the `outputs` ?
* What `variables` should be created ?
* What `initial values` should they have ?
* What `intermediate steps` should be taken to `compute other values` to ultimately `compute the output`?
* Do these repeat instructions that can be written in simplified form using a loop ?

# JS Things
* array index of an item indicates **how many items come before said item**
  - For example, index 0 means no items come before said item
  - index 5 means 5 items come before said item (because array index starts at 0)
