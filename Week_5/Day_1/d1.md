## Why Database
* `data` is `tied` to the `functionality of apps`
* Which means sometimes inorder to add new features, you need to update your database (by adding new tables perhaps)
* enable "smart / special" `interaction` (analyitics) with `data` 


## Web App Structure
**FRONT END --- BACK END --- DATABASE**
* `Front End` talks to `Back End` using:
  - HTTP Request
    1) Forms
    2) < a > tags
    3) Ajax (XHR requests)

* `Back End` uses `TCP` to talk to Database

## Database
* `Database` is a  `software` in which ...
* `data` goes `into` a `box` and `come out` of a `box`
* a `box` `listens` to `database queries` (via TCP)
* Database is its own piece of software that listens to TCP request that may or may not come locally
* **DATA ----> SERVER ----> BOX ------>**
* When you are using a Database mangement system, you are talking to the a software that does database request for you

## Relational Database Model
* Many `lists`(table) that are `linked` together, upon which you could `draw connections`  and `retrieve information` between those lists (tables)
* `SQL` is a langague to `talk to a relation database`
* **The relation describes the relationship between one table to another table**
* In relational database, the plan for organizing our data is to use lots of tables
* Database normalization has us distirbuting our data between multiple tables, therefore it is common for a single query to access data stored in multiple tables

## SQL Queries
* In the `SELECT` clause, you are selecting the `columns` from the table you want to retrieve information from
* By default, select targets every row, you can elminiate the targeted row by using `WHERE`
* Think about what do you want the end result of the query to be / look like
* Replace `Where` with `And` when you use `Left Join`
* COUNT only counts the entries where the value is not null

## SQL SUB SELECT
* Select within a select its called `SUB SELECT`
* If your column needs computation, you probably need a sub select
* Think of sub select as a nested for loop

## POSTGRES command
* `\l` list all the database in the POSTGRES database mangement system

# SQL TABLE CREATION
* `SERIAL`
  - data type allows you to automatically generate unique integer numbers 
* `NOT NULL` 
  - by `default`, a column can hold NULL values
  - NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values
  - use when the attribute is required
* `REFERENCES`, `ON DELETE CASCADE`
  - REFERENCES is the foriegn key in another table
  - foriegn key is the primary key in the table you have linked
  - A foreign key with cascade delete means that `if a record in the parent table is deleted`, `then the corresponding records in the child table will automatically be deleted `
* `\dt`
  - display all the tables in a database (that you are currently connected to)
  - \dt foo will display the table named foo
* `\i filename` - execute queries (stored in file) against a database
* `ALTER SEQUENCE students_id_seq RESTART WITH 193;`
  - `ALERT SEQUENCE` change the definition of a sequence generator
  - restart a sequence called `student_id_seq`, at 193
  - The sequence is a special type of data created to generate unique numeric identifier in POSTgreSQL

# SQL GROUP BY
* The `GROUP BY` clause is used with the SELECT statement to `make a group of rows` **based on the values of a specific column or expression**. The SQL `AGGREGATE function` can be used to `get summary information` **for every group and these are applied to an individual group**.

# SQL WHERE and HAVING
* The `WHERE` clause is used to `retrieve rows` based `on` a `certain condition`, but it **can not be applied to grouped result.**
* `HAVING` clause `retrieve rows from a grouped result against some condition`. **Grouping can happen after retrieves the rows from a table**. 
* **HAVING clause is evaluated before the SELECT so we can't use the alias total_submissions alias that is created in the SELECT**

# SQL QUERIES
* Using `COUNT` on a table meaning you are counting all the `instances` of an `entity`  (columns)
* So if you COUNT (*) on goals, then you are counting every goal

# SQL JOIN
* the `ON` keyword tells SQL which `columns` the `JOIN` should do on the tables we want to link
* the `ON` keyword tellus the table which column have to have a match inorder to JOIN (and return the result)
* Every JOIN must have an ON, the order of the JOIN does not matter, however
* When you join table, think about what each instances (row) of the joined table represent


## INNER JOIN
* `INNER JOIN` will only `give` us `rows` **where there is a match between the two tables**
* rows with null values for entries specified in ON will not be included 

## OUTER JOIN
* `OUTER JOIN` will include data where there isnt a match (null value for entries specified in ON)
* There are `3` different types of `OUTER JOIN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` or `FULL`
* An OUTER JOIN will join the tables similarly to an INNER JOIN but will return all results (being the columns specified in the SELECT clause) for one of the tables, even when the join condition is not met. For any row where the condition was not met, a row is added with NULL data.
* The `Left, Right, Full` specify `which table should have all of its rows returned`, `regardless of the condition being met `
* When you do JOIN, all the rows get mashed together, so if you want exclusively A, you can add a WHERE statement on columns that have the value null

## MULTI JOIN
* First JOIN creates a new table, then JOIN that new table to another table

## AGGERATE FUNCTION AND GROUP BY
* When you use aggerate function without the group by, you are using the aggerate function on the entire queries
* When you use the aggerate function with group by, you are using the aggerate function to groups of data
* So you are running the aggerate functino on whatever groups of data you are grouping by 
* GROUP BY allows us to combine the results based on a column so an aggergate function can be applied to each group
* Having allows us to filter our results based on the result of an aggergate function

## SUB SELECT 
* SUB SELECT can be used as a column of the SELECT clause
* can be used as a data source of another select statement
* Used within the WHERE clause (perhaps most common)

## Comparing values
* comparing something with a null value will give you false

## Correlated Subqueries
* A correlated subquery works like a nested loop: the subquery only has access to rows related to a single record at a time in the outer query. The technique relies on table aliases to identify two different uses of the same table, one in the outer query and the other in the subquery.

## SQL UNION
* The UNION operator combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statement
* The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement in the UNION.

## SQL CAST
* The CAST function converts a value of any time into a specified datatype

# GIT COMMIT MESSge
* use the message to let people know what you did, not what the website is now doing
* keep your commit message consistent
* put your sentences in present tense
