# Lecture

## How are DB related
* PK and FK need to be of the same data type

## Datatype
* `hstore` - key value pair similar to objects

## Relationship
* Relationship is different than JOIN (join is more about retreieving data from different tables)
* In One to Many, the PK lives in One amd FK lives in Many

## Importance of Data Integerity
* If not designed carefully to maintain data integerity and refferentail integerity, you will end up with lots of data that is garbaged and you cant query them

## Normalization
* **Single Source Of Truth**

### Design Concepts
* Initial state of the record
  - minimial about of data in order for you to create that record
* Intellgient Defaults
  - usually for non-required fields

### Designing a database
* mock up how the tables, columns and rows with fake data
* then clean up and draw it on ERD
* Think about what query you write inorder to retrieve the data to decide the data type

# How to Approach SQL
* For `Each` ? Probably need to `GROUP`
* `Total`? Probably need to `COUNT`
* Depending on what info you need to draw on each table, thats how you determine which table to JOIN
* The ON part of the JOIN is where the two tables are related 

# Database Design
* Classifying data and Identifiying interrelationships
1) Determine data to be stored
   - Requirement analysis
   - Requirement specification determins data to be stored
2) Determine data relationship
3) use not null on relationship that is not optional
4) use english words to identify the relationship first and then define your caridnality 

# Normalizing
1) Identifying Entity
2) Identifying Attributes
3) Identifying Dependency
* What happens a new ____ shows up ? Would there be a null in your data ?

# Dependency
* Direction dependency means the data depends on the existence of an entity
  - name, date of birth, depends on the existence of an employee
* Indirect dependency means the data does not depend on the existence of an entity
  - project infromation indirectly depends on an employee because a project can exist without an employee
* If A is dependent on B, then B will be a table
  
# Practice database design
* Think about random situation and design a database
