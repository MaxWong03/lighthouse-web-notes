# Lecture

## How are DB related
* PK and FK need to be of the same data type

## Datatype
* `hstore` - key value pair similar to objects

## Relationship
* Relationship is different than JOIN (join is more about retreieving data from different tables)
* In One to Many, the PK lives in One amd FK lives in Many

## Importance of Data Integerity
* If not designed carefully to maintain data integerity and refferentail integerity, you will end up with lots of data that is garbaged and you cant query them

## Normalization
* **Single Source Of Truth**

### Design Concepts
* Initial state of the record
  - minimial about of data in order for you to create that record
* Intellgient Defaults
  - usually for non-required fields

### Designing a database
* mock up how the tables, columns and rows with fake data
* then clean up and draw it on ERD
* Think about what query you write inorder to retrieve the data to decide the data type





# How to Approach SQL
* For `Each` ? Probably need to `GROUP`
* `Total`? Probably need to `COUNT`
* Depending on what info you need to draw on each table, thats how you determine which table to JOIN
* The ON part of the JOIN is where the two tables are related
