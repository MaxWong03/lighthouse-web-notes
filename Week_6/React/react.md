# React
* React is declarative
* React is component-based
  * Each component can receive data and maintain state
  * When a component recevies new data or changes its state then it will return element that will be rendered to the DOM

## Props & State
* TWo concepts in React that assist you in managing data
* Props are the data passed from a parent component to a child component
  * Similar to passing arguments to a function, but a component can't change the props passed to it
* State is private data managed internally by the component. 

# Declarative Compoenents
* Transfer the responsibility of manipulating the DOM to React
