# React Lecture

## How to Build Componenets
* Break each interfaces down into components, build them in isolation, and combine them together into one single user interface
* alt tag is for accessbility (when the img doesn't load, or when the user has bad eyes sight)

## Create a React App
* `npx create-react-app <project-dir>`

``` json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src"
  }
}
//in jsconfig.json
```
* This indicates that all your imports are coming from the `./src` folder
* `serviceworker` allows offline functionality
* `ReactDOM` interfaces `react` and the `browser`, the rendering layer. 
  * Takes react element and convert it to DOM element (render react element into DOM tree)
* `Controlled Components` is used to `control input` 
  * Controlled Components' `state` is its `value`
  * onChange `re-render` components as well as `keeping track of the state `(inside the component's value, using setWhatever)
* **New props being passed and a change of states will re-render components (given that the component is dynamic)**
