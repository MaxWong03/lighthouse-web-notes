# React Lecture

## How to Build Componenets
* Break each interfaces down into components, build them in isolation, and combine them together into one single user interface
* alt tag is for accessbility (when the img doesn't load, or when the user has bad eyes sight)

## Create a React App
* `npx create-react-app <project-dir>`

``` json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src"
  }
}
//in jsconfig.json
```
* This indicates that all your imports are coming from the `./src` folder
* `serviceworker` allows offline functionality
* `ReactDOM` interfaces `react` and the `browser`, the rendering layer. 
  * Takes react element and convert it to DOM element (render react element into DOM tree)
* `Controlled Components` is used to `control input` 
  * Controlled Components' `state` is its `value`
  * onChange `re-render` components as well as `keeping track of the state `(inside the component's value, using setWhatever)
* **New props being passed and a change of states will re-render components (given that the component is dynamic)**
* `.storybook/addons.js` is where you put storybook's `plugins'
* increase states in your componenets increase complexity
* build the html first then turn that into react components (you would have to convert it jsx)
* calling `action` returns a function, which you can pass to a componenet
* the second element of `useState` causes componenets to re-render

## Storybook
* storybook imports components

**New Syntax**
``` js
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@storybook/react/demo';

export default { title: 'Button' };

export const withText = () => <Button>Hello Button</Button>;

export const withEmoji = () => (
  <Button><span role="img" aria-label="so cool">😀 😎 👍 💯</span></Button>
);
```

**This will create the following when you run storybook**
```
Button
├── With Text
└── With Emoji
```
