## Reducer

* `Reducer` - taking a group of data, applying some action, and returning a single value that is the result of the accumlation of the action applied to each data in the group

**Reducer Example**
``` js
arr.reduce((accumlator, value) => {

}, initial)
/*
value represnets each single item in the array / data structure
accumulator is the value(accumlated) passed into each iteration
*/
```

## React Component design
* Put things that changes in your component
* and put things that are static outside of the component (so that it doesnt recompute everytime)

## Separation of Concerns
* `Breaking up behaviour`s and `re-orgnize state logic` in react are usually done in `Components` and `Hooks`
* `Separation of concerns` - separating the `rendering concern` from the `state management concern`

### Organizing our Logic
* Create a `custom Hook` to provide the `state` and `actions` used to `change the state`
  * **when any of the provided actions are called the state updates, causing the component to render**




## State and React
* State in react is a data set in which your interaction updates its values (or update is neccessary to allow interaction)

## Reducer with Array of Objects
* Objects can be considered as an action
* With each objects having the "type" of actions and the value
* and then the reducer performs the actions on the value depending on the action 

## Reducer and React
* Accumulator is the state 
* Value is the action you wish to do upon different data in state
* `useReducer` takes in the `reducer` and the `initial value`
* `dispatch` pass the `current state value`(automatically) and the `action` to `useReducer`
  * **dispatcher then gets the return valued of the reducer (which is the updated state) and update the state**
* `Reducer` should always be `pure`

## Reducer Implementation
1) If statements
2) Switch statements
  * use `Switch` for `Reducer` to allows a more clear `interface`
3) Look up
4) **Reducer should return the new version of the state**

### Lookup in Reducer
* `Lookup` is an `object` with the `Actions` defined `as Keys`
* Makes reducer simple, **reducer uses a look up to run the sets of defined actions**
* Further `abstract the actions(conditions of actions)` from the reducer
* **You could use a trenaory operator in reducer to incoperate default actions for reducer**

## useReducer
* `Reduce` describes the process of `taking multiple values` and `processing them` one by one to create a single value
* The userReducer Hook is an alternative to the useState Hook, helps us manage more complex state logic
* When we want to `alter` the `state` with a `reducer`, we `dispatch` an `action` that `describes` the `change we want to make`
* **reducer alter states (provided by the dispatcher) depending on the action provided by the dispatcher and return the new version of the state to the dispatcher**
* **the dispatcher then updates the state**
1) ` dispatch an action`
2) `reducer handle action` 
3) ` reducer replace the current state`
4) `component renders using the latest state to generate an updated view.`
