# Lecture
* `jest` provides general matcher (primitives, objects)
* `jest-dom` provides specific matcher for doms
* `react testing libraries` provides queries that `behaves like css selectors` that returns a dom element


# Testing React
* A `component` and all of `its children` will be considered `a unit`

## Structure
1) `Initialize` the `component` that we would like to test
2) `Trigger` the `change` that `executes` the `unit`
3) `Verify` that the unit produced the `expected result`
* **The most basic test we do for any React component is a test render that verifies we can render the component to the DOM without throwing an error**
``` js
it("renders without crashing", () => {
  render(<Button />);
});
/*
First argument: descriptive name for the test
Second argument: function that contains the test code

The state change is going from unmounted to mounted
*/
```
* When you call `render`, there is a `mock document` generated for you which you can call `.toBeInDocument` on to test if your component is rendered inside a document
