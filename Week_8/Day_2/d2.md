# Testing
1) `Arrange`
   - set up initial app state
   - visit a web page
   - query for an element
2) `Act` 
   - take an action
   - interact with that element
3) `Assert` 
   - make an assertion about the updated application state
   - page content
   - Assertions are just commands that enable you to describe the desired state of your application.
