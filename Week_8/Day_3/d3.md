# Lecture
* History in the browser is a JS object
* Final Project - 1) react router 2) react component library 3) React Context API
* In react, your backend server is mostly used to fetch external api data for your clients to render


# React
* Take user interface, and split it into independent units called components
* Types and properties of components describe the behaviours and looks of the UI

# Component Lifecycle
1) `Mount` phase
   * `happens once` when we create a component instance
   * `constructor`, `render`, `componentDidMount`
2) `Update` phase
   * component that is `mounted` can be `updated`
   * Two ways to update
    1) `Pass props` when a parent render
    2) `Update internal state`
   * React calls `update lifecycle` each time the component is updated (`render`, `componetDidUpdate`)
3) `Unmount` phase 
   * `happens once`
   * `componentWillUnmount`

# Lifecycle methods
* `componentDidMount` 
  - check if there is saved focus state (in local storage)after we render the application the first time
* `componentDidUpdate` 
  - listen for changes to the state
  - Has access to the props and state from the previous update

# Ruby notes
* `Rail is a gem`, just like express is a package in node
* `Gems` are packages in Node
