# Ruby Blocks
* `arguments` are how we pass in data to methods
* `blocks` are how we pass in behaviour to methods (chunck of logic your method can run)
* `yield` executes `block`, if block takes in an argument, then `yield` with executes `block` with its `provided value `


## Block Syntax
``` ruby 
# First Syntax
def print_result
  result_from_block = yield
  puts result_from_block
end

def print_result(&block)
  result_from_block = block.call
  puts result_from_block
end
```


# Ruby Things
* `#` indicates something is a method of an object
* `!` after a method mutates the object


# Testing notes
* Writing tests allows you to learn the current implementation and find bugs in the existing implementation
* Dont have to test everything. Just the things that are fragile, or that we are unsure of
* If you arent sure what tests to write first, then dont write any. But as soon as you find a bug in the project, write a test to ensure that bu no longer exists (Regression test)

# Tech In Notes
* make sure you are solving what you were asked for 
* go for the simplest solution first
* state your assumptions at the beginning
* ask for clarification as soon as you are stuck
