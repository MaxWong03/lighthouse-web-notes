# Lecture


# Testing notes
* Writing tests allows you to learn the current implementation and find bugs in the existing implementation
* Dont have to test everything. Just the things that are fragile, or that we are unsure of
* If you arent sure what tests to write first, then dont write any. But as soon as you find a bug in the project, write a test to ensure that bu no longer exists (Regression test)

# Tech In Notes
* make sure you are solving what you were asked for 
* go for the simplest solution first
* state your assumptions at the beginning
* ask for clarification as soon as you are stuck
