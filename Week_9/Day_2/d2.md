# Rail Notes

## Controller
* `Receive` specific `requests` for `application`
* **Routing decides which controller recevies which requests**
* There could be more than one route to each controller
* Different `routes` can be **served by** `action`
* `Action` **collects** information to provide it to a `view`
* `Inside the controller` you define `methods` that will become the `actions` for the controller (these actions perform CRUD)
* **Only public method can be actions for controllers**
* Store reference to an object in an instnace variable because Rail pass all instance variables to the view

## View
* `Display` information in a human readable format
* information is collected in the controller, and view display such information

## Routes
* **Route needs to have a controller defined in order to serve the request**

## Model
* corresponds to a database table that uses a plural name

# MVC in Rails
* `Borwser` sends `requests`
* `Server receives` the request and `passes` to `Rails controller` 
  - Rails routes an action to a controller
* `Controller` interacts with `model`
* `Controller` **renders the view** and **return the web page** back to the browser
  - Controller passes instance variables to the view
* `Controller` is in charge of `what to do next`
* `Model` is 
  - Ruby object that represnet an element of the site
  - in charge of communicating with the database
