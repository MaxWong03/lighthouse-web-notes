## Controller
* `Receive` specific `requests` for `application`
* **Routing decides which controller recevies which requests**
* There could be more than one route to each controller
* Different `routes` can be **served by** `action`
* `Action` **collects** information to provide it to a `view`

## View
* `Display` information in a human readable format
* information is collected in the controller, and view display such information
